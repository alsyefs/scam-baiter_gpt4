        "body": "Hello Mr. Matthew Anderson,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me and providing such detailed information about the fund. It's quite surprising to hear about this, as I wasn't aware of any funds in my name.\n\nBefore we proceed, could you please clarify a few things for me? How did these funds come to be in my name? And why were the bank officials not willing to inform me about this?\n\nI'm also curious about the process of transferring these funds. You mentioned it would be done via the fastest method of wire transfer - could you explain how that works?\n\nI appreciate your assistance and look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nChristopher"
