        "body": "Hello Ojuolape,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with such an intriguing proposition. I must admit, it's not every day that one receives a message from the United Nations Population Fund UNFPA. \n\nI'm curious about this situation and would like to understand more. Could you please provide more details about the asylum boy? How did he come into possession of such a large amount of money? And why was it transported in boxes?\n\nAlso, could you explain what exactly is expected of me in this process? What kind of help do you need from my end?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest wishes,\nSara"
