My\ncolleague sometime in the past solicited for your partnership in a\ntransaction in regard to getting some funds transferred to your\naccount but you opted out due to reasons best known to you, which left\nthe transaction pending then.\nWell he later solicited for my partnership and support on the same\ntransaction, though he informed me about your effort to assist him. We\ntherefore agreed to compensate you after a successful transfer.\nI am very happy to inform you about our success in getting the funds\ntransferred under my co-operation. We left London, UK for Paris,\nFrance to have our fun and Share the Joy of the successful\ntransaction. hehehehe don't you ever think that we forgot you, no we\ndidn't forget your past efforts and zeal to assist at that time.\nPersonally I love being transparent.\nAnyway as agreed to compensate you to show our gratitude, we bought\nsome gifts which include Gold Jewelries, iPads and Laptops for you. We\ntried to call you on the phone but to no avail. We are flying to China\ntomorrow for investments and will barely have access to email. Due to\ntime constraints we had no other option than to leave the items with\nFedEx Courier Service to convey the items to you pending your address\nreconfirmation.\nInside the laptops bags, you will see $20,000 each (that's 9 laptops)\nmaking it $180,000 USD. I hid them inside the laptops bags so that\nnobody will see it. Instruction has been given the FedEx Courier\nService to deliver the items to you as soon as you reconfirm your\nreceiving details to them. I will be very busy with travel\narrangement, flying to China like i told you so i will barely have\naccess to mail. Hence I thought it wise to furnish you with FedEx\nCourier Service contact details at once so as to enable you contact\nthem when you are able to read this mail.\nBelow are their contact details.... now E-mail them immediately and\nask about item code: \"9864543/pending/delivery\" by me.\nCompany Name: FedEx Courier Service\nContact Person: Mrs Adam Rebecca Alice.\nEmail: \noffice112366@aol.com\nThank you very much for your zeal to assist then. Let friendly love\ncontinue! I???m off....Take care and God bless. so feel free to get in\ntouch with them. Pls pray for our safe trip. Please note that the\ncourier company don???t know anything about the hiding money in the\nlaptops, don???t ever disclose it to them.\nMrs Maria Moore"

It's not every day that someone offers me such generous gifts. \n\nI'm curious about your travels. What brings you to China? And how did you manage to get the funds transferred successfully? \n\nAlso, could you please provide more details about this courier service? How can I contact them and what information do they need from me?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nAnthony"
