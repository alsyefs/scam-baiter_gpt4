        "body": "Hello Mr. Ugochukwu A. Nwaghodoh,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me and providing such detailed information about the ATM card. It's quite surprising to hear that there's an ATM card with such a large sum belonging to me.\n\nI'm curious, how did this situation come about? I don't recall having any dealings overseas or participating in any lottery or gambling activities. Could you please provide more details on this?\n\nAlso, I would like to know more about the process of receiving this ATM card. If I choose the courier service option, how long would it take for the card to reach me? And what kind of security measures are in place during its transit?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nElizabeth"
