I'm not entirely sure I understand everything you've mentioned though.\n\nYou mentioned something about registering as a member of IMF AND CDA. Could you please explain more about this? What are the benefits of being a member?\n\nAlso, you mentioned a fee that needs to be sent through Ria or Money Gram or Steam Wallet Gift Card card. Could you clarify what this fee is for exactly?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nFrank"
