I must say, it's not every day that I receive such an email.\n\nI'm a bit confused about the payment slip you mentioned. Could you please provide more details about this? What is it for exactly?\n\nAlso, I noticed that you've shared some account information. Is there a specific reason for this? \n\nLooking forward to hearing back from you.\n\nBest wishes,\nJanice"
