I'm quite surprised to hear about this situation involving Mrs. Rose Frank and the unclaimed Deposited Box. \n\nTo answer your question, no, I did not sign any Deed of Agreement in favor of Mrs. Rose Frank or anyone else for that matter. This is all very new and unexpected to me.\n\nCould you please provide more details about this unclaimed Deposited Box? What exactly does it contain? And how did my name get associated with it?\n\nAlso, could you clarify what steps I need to take next? You mentioned coming over to your office in Europe - could you provide more information on that?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nJoe"
