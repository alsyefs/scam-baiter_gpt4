        "body": "Hello Friend,\n\nThank you for your detailed message. I must say, it's quite a surprise to hear about this large sum of money associated with my name. \n\nI'm curious, how did you come across this information? And why is it that the funds are being held by RIA Money Transfer? \n\nYou mentioned some documents that need to be provided for clearance. Could you please elaborate on what these documents are and why they are necessary?\n\nAlso, I noticed that there's a fee of Five Hundred and Fifty Dollars for these documents. Is there any way to waive or reduce this fee? \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nThomas"
