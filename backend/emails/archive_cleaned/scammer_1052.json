        "body": "Hello Mr. Garry John,\n\nThank you for your email. I must say, it's quite an exciting prospect to be receiving such a large sum of money! I'm just a little confused about some parts of your message.\n\nYou mentioned something about an activation fee that needs to be paid. Could you please explain more about this? How much is the fee and why is it necessary?\n\nAlso, you mentioned sending the fee with CARDS like AZON CARD, GOOGLE PLAY GIFT CARD or ITUNES CARD. I'm not very familiar with these methods of payment. Could you please provide more details on how they work?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nMisty"
