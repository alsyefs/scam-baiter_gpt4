        "body": "Dear Michael,\r\n\r\nI know this way of communication is not the most secure channel to pass a\r\nmessage of this importance but right now, it is the quickest means\r\navailable to me, please bear with me.\r\n\r\nMy name is Mr Leonard William Esq, an Attorney at Law. This involves a\r\nforeign client of mine, who hereafter shall be referred to as my client,\r\nwho died as a result of a heart-related condition in November, 2012.\r\n\r\nI have contacted you to assist in transferring the money left behind by my\r\nclient before it is confiscated or declared UN-serviceable by the Bank\r\nwhere  this deposit valued at 6.7million dollars is lodged.This Bank has\r\nissued me  a notice to contact the next of kin, or the account will be\r\nconfiscated.\r\n\r\nMy proposition to you is to seek your consent to present you as the next-\r\nof-kin and beneficiary of my late client, so that the proceeds of this\r\naccount can be paid to you. Then we can share  the amount on a mutually\r\nagreed-upon percentage. All legal documents to back up your claim as my\r\nclient's next-of-kin will be provided. All I require is your honest\r\ncooperation to enable us to see this transaction through.\r\n\r\nPlease contact me at once to indicate your interest. Do understand that\r\nthis transaction does require utmost confidence and you should keep this\r\nmail to yourself notwithstanding if you are rejecting the transaction or\r\naccepting it.\r\n\r\nNote that I reserve the right to reject your acceptance of this proposal if\r\nI have reasons to believe that you may not be honest or discrete as it\r\nconcerns this proposal.\r\n\r\nFurther details will be given as soon as your interest is indicated.\nBest Regards,\r\nMr Leonard William (Esq)"
