        "body": "Dear A. Wray, III,\n\nI appreciate your message and the information provided. However, I must express my confusion regarding the details of this transaction. \n\nYou mentioned an ATM card worth US Billion Dollars in your office, but I'm not aware of any such card that belongs to me. Could you please provide more details about this? How did it come into your possession and why is it associated with me?\n\nAlso, you mentioned a fee for Laundering which costs Dollars. Could you clarify what this fee is for and why it's necessary? \n\nLastly, you suggested sending the fee through Gift Cards or Steam Wallet Gift Cards or via Ria or Western Union. This seems unusual for an official transaction with the Federal Bureau.\n\nI would appreciate if you could provide more clarity on these points so I can understand better how to proceed.\n\nBest wishes,\nThelma"
