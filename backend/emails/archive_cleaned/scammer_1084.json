        "body": "Hello Pastor Donald Richardson,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I must say, your message has certainly piqued my interest. It's not every day that one receives such a unique business proposal.\n\nI'm sorry to hear about the passing of the individual who shares my surname. However, I can't recall any relatives who were surgeons or lived in New York. Could you perhaps share more details about this person? Maybe there's a distant connection that I'm unaware of.\n\nAlso, could you please elaborate on how exactly I can assist with the transfer of these funds? What would be required from me?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nShawna"
