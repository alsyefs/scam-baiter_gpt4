        "body": "  Greetings from Rev. Moore. It is my pleasure to share the good work Of God with you, I received Christ, knowing the truth and the truth have set me free. Having known the truth, I had no choice than to do what is lawful and right in the sight of God for internal life and in the sight of man for witness of God's mercy and glory upon my life. I have the pleasure to share my testimony with you; I am Rev.J Moore, the legal adviser to late Mr. And Mrs. Imhuasen Joseph a Russian couple that lived in my country for 25 years before they died in the Bellevue plane crash. They were so good Christian, they so Dedicated to God but they had no child till they died. Throughout their stayed in my country, they acquired a lot of properties like Lands, house properties, etc. As their legal adviser, before their death, they instructed me to write their WILL. Because they had no child, they dedicated their wealth to God. According to the WILL, the properties have to be sold and the money will be given out to a ministry for the work of God, Orphanage Home ,As Their legal adviser, all the documents for the Properties were in my care. They gave me the authority to sale the properties and give out the fund to the Ministries for the work of God. Though I sold all the properties after their death, as they instructed me and as a matter of fact, after I sold all their properties, I realized more than Fifteen million, five hundred thousand US Dollars ($15.5m), and what supposed to be the percentage interest of my right legal fee was firstly deducted by me out of the total amount realized from the sold Properties, this was based on the initial agreement between i and my client before their death. Therefore, the total amount left to be invested into God's work as instructed by my client Mr. and Mrs. Imhuasen Joseph is Fifteen million, five hundred Thousand US Dollars ($15.5m) Instead of giving the main fund out for the work of God as instructed to me by the owner before their death. I converted the fund to myself with the intention of investing the fund abroad for my personal use. I was afraid of putting the fund in the Bank, because I have to give account to the bank on how I got the money. I then packaged the fund in consignments in a box and deposited the consignments with a security Company. I did not want the management of the Security Company to know the content of the consignments; therefore, I registered the content of the consignments as Family treasures had encounter with Christ when Rev. Billy Graham was preaching on television concerning Ananias and Sapphire in Acts 5:1!-11. After hearing the word of God, I gave my life to Christ and became a born again Christian. As a born again Christian, I started reading my bible and one day, the Lord opened my eyes to Ezekiel 33: 18 and 19 where the word of God says: \"When the righteous truth from his righteousness, and committed iniquity, he shall even die thereby. But if the wicked turn from his wickedness, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby\". From the scripture, I discovered that the only way I could have peace in my life is to do what is lawful and right by Giving out the fund as instructed for the work of God by the owner before her death. I have asked God for forgiveness and I know that God have forgiven me. But I have to do what is lawful and right in the sight of God by giving out the fund to the chosen ministry for the purpose of God's work as instructed by the owner before they died. After my fasting and prayers, I asked God to make his choice and direct me to a honest Christian after my fervent prayer. On your interest please direct your email message to my private email AT \nmoveofgodministry@disciples.com\n for immediate details on how we can Proceed. Yours in Christ Rev.J Moore   "
