I will not engage anyone that I\r\ndon't know or trust his capacity.  The already assigned delivery team will\r\nwork with specifications and mandate.  To ensure easy and effective\r\ndelivery,  you will have to provide your full name, your phone number and\r\naddress where you to receive your fund. The information mentioned above\r\nwill be used to file your fund paperwork and that is the information we\r\nwill use to deliver your fund to you.\r\n\r\nIn sending the payment, you can simply buy Apple gift card $350 from store\r\nand send the card to me here. Attach the picture of the card and it's\r\nreceipt on my email here so we can proceed.  Once the card is received, I\r\nwill proceed with your fund paperwork filing and then your delivery will\r\ncommence.  Thank you for your understanding.\r\n\nPatrick Morrissey"
