However, I must admit that I'm not entirely familiar with the terms BG SBLC. Could you please explain what these are and how they might benefit me?\n\nAlso, you mentioned attached documents but I didn't find any in your message. Could you kindly resend them? \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nRandy"
