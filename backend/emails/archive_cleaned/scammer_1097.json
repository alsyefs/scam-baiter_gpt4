        "body": "Hello there,\n\nThank you for sharing this important information. It's quite alarming to hear about these fictitious email messages claiming to be from the Office of the Currency or its senior officials. I understand that these emails are asking for a Bitcoin Wallet Address ID NO, which is supposedly needed for a fund transfer.\n\nI'm curious though, how did you come across this information? Have you personally received such an email or did someone else share it with you? \n\nAlso, could you please clarify what you mean by \"The OCC does not in the transfer of funds for, or on behalf of, business or entities.\"? Is there a word missing in this sentence?\n\nLastly, I appreciate the list of agencies where consumers can file complaints. This will surely be helpful for those who might encounter such scams. Do these agencies work together to investigate and resolve these issues?\n\nLooking forward to your response!\n\nBest wishes,\nSamira"
