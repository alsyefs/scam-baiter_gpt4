        "body": "Hello Mr. Patrick Uba,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I must say, your letter has taken me by surprise! I wasn't aware that I was involved in a motor accident and currently in the hospital. That's quite a shock to hear.\n\nAs for Mr. Karl Briggs, his name doesn't ring any bells for me. Could you perhaps tell me more about him? How did he come to be my legal advocate?\n\nAlso, could you provide more details about this fund you mentioned? It's the first time I'm hearing about it and I'm curious to know more.\n\nLooking forward to your reply.\n\nBest wishes,\nWilliam"
