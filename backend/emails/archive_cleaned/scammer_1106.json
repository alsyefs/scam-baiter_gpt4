        "body": "Hello Mr. Bowie Denis,\n\nThank you for your email and the information provided. It's quite interesting to hear about this opportunity. I must say, it's not every day that one receives such news.\n\nI understand that an investor is willing to cover all expenses related to this process, which is very generous indeed. However, I'm a bit unclear about the part where the investor demands a percentage of my total payment. Could you please elaborate on this? What exactly does this mean?\n\nAlso, could you provide more details about the process itself? What does signing the fund release bond entail? And what are the steps involved in proceeding to the cash payment centre for immediate payment?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nElizabeth"
