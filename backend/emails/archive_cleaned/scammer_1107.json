        "body": "Hello Ms. Anna Wilson,\n\nThank you for your email and the information provided. It's quite surprising to hear about this accrued interest on a deposit I wasn't aware of. \n\nCould you please provide more details about this? How did my name come up in connection with this deposit? And could you explain a bit more about how the United Nations is involved?\n\nAlso, I'm curious about the process of receiving these funds via bank transfer or ATM VISA CARD. Could you elaborate on how that works?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nCarla"
