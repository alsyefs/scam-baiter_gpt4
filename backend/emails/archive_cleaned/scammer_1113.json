It's not every day that one hears about a dormant account with such a substantial amount of money.\n\nCould you please provide more details about this situation? How did you come across this account and why is it dormant? Also, what would being your partner entail?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nDonna"
