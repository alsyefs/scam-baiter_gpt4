It's been a while indeed since we last communicated, and I must say your email caught me by surprise! \n\nYou mentioned something about funds that are ready for me to receive? That sounds interesting, could you please elaborate more on this? What is the nature of these funds and why am I receiving them?\n\nAlso, you mentioned a charge that needs to be paid. Could you provide more details about this charge? What is it for exactly?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nDaniel"
