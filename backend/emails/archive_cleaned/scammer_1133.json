        "body": "  Attn:\nThis is to remind you that we are patiently waiting for you to come back to us so we can finalize the release of your unpaid funds. Because this office as a new reform foreign debt reconciliation committee has been constituted under the UN Secretary-General.  we are working in collaboration with the Special Fraud Investigations Unit (SFIU) and we have decided to waive away all Clearance Fees/Taxes, and charges and authorize the Government Authority concerned to affect your overdue Inherited Contract funds worth $4.8 million USD without any delay as approved and instructed by the IMF. However, I have devoted myself and time to seeing that you will no longer be made to pay a Cent after obtaining the required \" WAIVER OPTION WAP15\" until you receive your ATM CARD and that will be short.\nAll you need to do is to secure â€œWAIVER OPTION WAP15\" from the Federal Ministry of Justice for $1000 only. May I educate you on what WAIVER OPTION WAP15 will do for you, A waiver is an act of waiving, or not insisting on, some right, claim, or privilege\". When you secure this waiver certification, all fees whether seen or unseen will be waived aside for you until you receive your money in your bank account. You will not be made to pay for any fees again until you confirm the fund in your bank account after which you will then defray all the costs with a little interest.\nIn line with the new fiscal policy regulations, the only money you will ever spend as far as this fund transfer is concerned is the cost of obtaining this WAIVER OPTION WAP15. Once you are able to secure this Waiver Evaluation Request- as a PREREQUISITE to your payment approval, all your transfer problems will be over. No matter the kind of fee, the WAIVER will take care of it, even the fee presently holding your transfer or ATM Card from being completed, this WAIVER will nullify it and the transfer will be completed without you paying 1 Penny until you confirm the transfer in your account ATM is at your doorstep.\nRegards\nMr. David Luka Andro    "
