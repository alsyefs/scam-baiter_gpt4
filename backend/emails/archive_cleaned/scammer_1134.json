And you ask me if I am joking and I told you that I am not I only need a trustworthy person. I was sacked and the only way to move this money is by ATM card, had it been I have enough money i will come in person with the card so that we can start off our investment. Please keep this secret here is my number\n+2349081589379\nPrince"

Also, it must have been tough being sacked. How are you managing things now?\n\nI appreciate your trust in sharing this with me and rest assured, your secret is safe. However, I'd prefer if we continue our conversation here rather than over the phone. Looking forward to hearing more about this.\n\nBest wishes,\nLan"
