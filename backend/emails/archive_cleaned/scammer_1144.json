        "body": "Hello Ruben,\r\nSorry  for my late response i have been very busy for the past few days finalizing arrangements for my late mother's burial.\r\nFirst, I must insist on your confidence in this transaction. I made this contact with you based on reliable information available to me courtesy of an agency that helps seek people by their email, and confirmed by my local chambers of commerce and industry concerning your reputation. Thus I am convinced you would be capable of providing me with a solution to a money transfer transaction of US$10,200,000.00(Ten Million, Two Hundred Thousand United States Dollars).\r\n \r\nIn 2013, my client was going through a horrendous divorce and he was on the verge of losing most of his estate to his vicious and diabolical wife according to what he told me. As a result of this alarming predicament, my client came to me with an idea. He transferred some funds totally ($10.2m) to a fixed deposit account in my bank under an alias which only the two of us knew about as the confidentiality of the matter was necessary for his protection.\r\n \r\nBut lost him to the cold hands of death after his divorce in early 2014, the funds have been sitting in the account ever since and will continue to do so perpetually unless we do something about it. According to practice, the Private banking sector will by the end of this year broadcast a request for statement of claim to Land Bank of the Philippines failing to receive viable claims they will probably revert the deposit to the Management of Land Bank of the Philippines. This will result in the money entering the Land Bank of the Philippines accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of the private banking division. What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration of Ten {10} years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Philippines Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.\r\n \r\nNow, I am prepared to give the necessary details to you as the closest surviving relation of our deceased customer.  I am also proposing that after a successful execution of the business deal, the allocation of our money will be as follows: 40% to you for your part in this, 50% for me and 10% for any unforeseeable expenses we may incur as the initiator of the deal. You know that I must have done my home work already before contacting you. Although the project is capital intensive, I know I will be able to pull it through following proper banking and legal channels with your assistance at your end. I will tidy up the legal aspect with the assistance of a lawyer who will prepare all the documents that will be needed to transfer the money from the Philippines to your country. Once more, I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail and forget I ever contacted you, I ask that you do not be vindictive and destructive; do not destroy my career.\r\n \r\nOpportunities like this only come once in a lifetime. I am a family man and this is an opportunity for me to give my family the best in life. I would like you to think about this and let me know your decision. If you give me a positive response, I will give you the relevant INFORMATION for the successful transfer of these funds and we both enjoy it in peace.\r\n \r\nI wish to inform you that you should not contact me via official channels else I will deny knowing you and about this Transaction. I will assure you of your safety and mine and everything will be done 100% legally,\r\n \r\nThis should be kept very secret and confidential. I believe you know and all our correspondence should be strictly on email alone.\r\n \r\nI await your response.\nRegards,\r\nRamon Domingo.\r\nLand Bank of the Philippines"
