Could you please provide more details about this? \n\nAlso, could you explain what the Economic Community Of West African States (ECOWAS) has to do with my situation? I'm a bit confused about their involvement.\n\nI appreciate your help in understanding this matter better.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nKarl"
