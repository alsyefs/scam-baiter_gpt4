I am doing well and hope the same for you. \n\nI am surprised to hear about Miss Josephine Phillip and the cheque she has issued in my name. However, I must clarify that I have not been in contact with her or any bank regarding an ATM card or any sum of money.\n\nBefore proceeding further, could you please provide more details about this situation? How did Miss Josephine come to issue a cheque in my name? And why is it necessary to transfer this money through Western Union?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nSabrina"
