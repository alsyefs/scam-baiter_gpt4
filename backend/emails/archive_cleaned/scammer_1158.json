I'm excited about this opportunity, but I have a few questions if you don't mind.\n\nFirstly, could you please explain why there is a fee involved in receiving my ATM Master Card? Also, why is it necessary to purchase an Amazon gift card or Bitcoin for payment?\n\nI'm looking forward to your response and thank you again for your time!\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nAnne"
