        "body": "Hello Rev John Chris,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, your message is quite intriguing! It's not every day that one hears about such a large sum of money. \n\nI'm curious though, how did my name come up in this situation? And could you please explain more about the \"due bank payment transfer process\" you mentioned? I'm not very familiar with these banking terms.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nJimmy"
