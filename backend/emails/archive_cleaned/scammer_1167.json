It's not every day that one receives an email about such a significant sum of money.\n\nI'm curious, how was my name selected for this? And could you please explain more about the Africa Union and their role in this process? \n\nAlso, I'd love to know more about the Diplomatic Courier Service. How does it work exactly?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nOfelia"
