        "body": "Dear Mr. Richard Moseley,\n\nThank you for your email and the information provided. I am glad to hear that HSBC has been successful in opening a checking account in my name.\n\nHowever, before proceeding further, I would like to clarify a few things. Firstly, could you please provide me with more details about the activation fee? Why is it necessary and what will it be used for?\n\nSecondly, I would appreciate if you could explain why the payment of this fee should be made through Walmart or via gift cards? This seems unusual for a banking transaction.\n\nLastly, could you please confirm the exact amount that will be transferred into my account? In your email, you mentioned \"Million from HSBC BANK\" but did not specify an amount.\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nPatricia"
