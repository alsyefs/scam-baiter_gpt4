        "body": "   Hello!\nI sincerely apologize for sending you this sensitive  information\nthrough email instead of a certified mail,  post-mail, telephone or\nface to face\nconversation, it's due to the urgency and importance of the security\ninformation.\nMy name is Mr. John Nicholas. The new Director Of International\nRemittance, Central Bank Of Africa Sarl {CBA} this note was taken in\nmy office where one of\nour managers was serving verification documents to two White men. Mr.\nAlbert Woods and Mr. Robert Anderson who stormed our office on your\nbehalf.\nThese two white men claimed to be your representative here and your\nsupervisory Engineer so they came to supervise your payment with our\nBank on your behalf\nand to claim you but because of their inability to have paid at the\nagreed time. They said that you were dead and before your\ndeath, you appointed them as the next of kin to your compensation,\nInheritance / Next of Kin payment presently under our custody.\nThese two white men and A black man quickly applied that your payment\nshould be presented to them at the spot.The Officials that are\nresponsible for the\npresentation ofth consignment quickly granted APPROVALS to their\napplication and packaged your payment for them to go with it. When the\nIvory Security\nCompany & Sacc. Services Debit\nteams arrived and the note was submitted to my desk for final\nApprovals before forwarding it to them for endorsement, I noticed that\nthere were discrepancies\nas there was no evidence of an authorization letter from you for the\nchange of beneficiary & information.\nMyself as the New Director of International remittance of The Central\nBank Of Africa Sarl urgently summoned The Officials responsible for\nthe presentation of\nthe consignment and directed them to stop the movement of the funds\nand at the same time I placed a stop order instruction on the funds\npending when your\nviews and comments are received with regards to this matter? Meanwhile\nyour immediate report is highly needed, for us to attach their picture\nfor your\nperusal and file and response to me will be highly imperative for your\ncomments which will be highly appreciated, but we will not hesitate to\ncontinue the\npayment transmission to them if no response comes from you.\nas your silence will be a clear indication that you authorized them to\neffect the above changes on your behalf!?!?!? Note! when reporting\nback to me do re-\nconfirm your full information as below for our perusal and file before\nwe can be able to arrest them and deliver your Consignment of Funds to\nyou immediately\nthrough diplomatic tunnel on non inspection route direct to your\ndoorstep over there or via International Cashier's Check, ATM Swift\nCard or through Bank to\nBank Wire transfer any of your choice Viz:\n(1) Your Full Name:\n(2) Your Residence or Office address where the consignment\ncan be delivered to you immediately.\n(3) Your Mobile Telephone Number for easy communication.\n(4) Your Company's Name & Address {IF ANY}\n(5) Sex / Age / Occupation.\n(6) This is to avoid wrongful delivery of your valued\npayment to wrong hand or wrong person.\n(7) If you want the Funds transferred to you VIA Bank to Bank wire\ntransfer direct to any of your choice bank account anywhere in the\nworld, then you have to\nsend us\nyour below information:\n(A) Full Name:\n(B) House or Office Address:\n(c) Direct Telephone Number:\n(D) Bank Name:\n(E) Bank Address:\n(F) Account Number:\n(G) Account Holder Name:\n(H) ABA / Routing Numbers:\nLet us know the option which you would like to receive before we can\nproceed!?!?!? as indecision and delays are the parents of failure so\navoid them now If\nwe delay a decision, the opportunity is gone forever.

        "body": "Hello Mr. John Nicholas,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with this information. I must say, it's quite surprising to hear about these two gentlemen claiming to be my representatives. I don't recall appointing anyone as my next of kin or authorizing any changes on my behalf.\n\nI'm curious, could you provide more details about these individuals? What exactly were they trying to accomplish? And how did they come across my information?\n\nAlso, I would like to know more about the payment that is currently under your custody. Could you please elaborate on what this payment is for and why it was made in the first place?\n\nI appreciate your diligence in handling this matter and look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nWillie"
