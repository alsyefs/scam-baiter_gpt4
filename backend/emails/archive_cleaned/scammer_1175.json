I appreciate your efforts in trying to resolve this matter as quickly as possible. \n\nI am curious about a few things though, if you don't mind me asking. Could you please explain why my payment has been delayed? Also, could you provide more information about the process that will be followed once I provide my details?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nVaughn"
