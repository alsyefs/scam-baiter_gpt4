        "body": "Hello Thamos Leclair,\n\nWow, this is such exciting news! I can't believe I'm going to receive an ATM card loaded with Two Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars. That's a lot of money!\n\nI have a few questions though, if you don't mind. You mentioned that the ATM card comes with a handbook or manual to enlighten me on how to use it. Could you give me a brief overview of how it works? Also, will there be any charges for using the ATM card?\n\nYou also mentioned that the card needs to be renewed in 4 years time. How would I go about doing that? \n\nRegarding the delivery of the ATM card, could you tell me more about how it will be shipped? Will it be sent through regular mail or via courier service? And what kind of packaging will it come in?\n\nI'm really looking forward to receiving my ATM card and starting this new chapter in my life. Thank you so much for your help!\n\nBest wishes,\nCharles"
