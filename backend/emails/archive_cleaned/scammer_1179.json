        "body": "Hello Robert William Jr,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I'm surprised to hear about this situation. I can assure you that I am very much alive and well, and I have no brother named Mr. John Hilliard.\n\nI'm curious, how did Mr. Hilliard provide proof of my supposed death? And why would he be the one to collect my funds? \n\nAlso, could you please explain more about this fund transfer process? How does it work exactly?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nP.S: Please note that due to privacy concerns, I won't be able to share any personal information like full name, mobile phone number, home address etc.\n\nBest wishes,\nShauna"
