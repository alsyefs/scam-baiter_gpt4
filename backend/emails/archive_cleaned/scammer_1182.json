        "body": "Dear Friend,\nI decided to write you this proposal in good faith, believing that you\nwill not betray me. I have been in search of someone with the same\nlast name of our late customer and close friend of mine ( Mr. Richard\n), hence \nI contacted you because both of you bear the same surname and\ncoincidentally from the same country\n, and I was pushed to contact you\nand see how best we can assist each other. Meanwhile I am Mr. Robert\nSzabados, a reputable banker here in Accra Ghana.\nOn the 15 January 2009, the young millionaire ( Mr. Richard  ) a\ncitizen of your country and Crude Oil dealer made a fixed deposit with\nmy bank for 60 calendar months, valued at US$6,500,000.00 (Six\nMillion, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) and the mature date for\nthis deposit contract was on 15th of January, 2015. But sadly he was\namong the death victims in the 11 March 2011, Earthquake disaster in\nJapan that killed over 20,000 people including him. Because he was in\nJapan on a business trip and that was how he met his end.\nMy bank management is yet to know about his death, but I knew about it\nbecause he was my friend and I am his Account Relationship Officer,\nand he did not mention any Next of Kin / Heir when the account was\nopened, because he was not married and no children. Last week my Bank\nManagement reminded me again requested that Mr. Richard should give\ninstructions on what to do about his funds, if to renew the contract\nor not.\nI know this will happen and that is why I have been looking for a\nmeans to handle the situation, because if my Bank Directors happens to\nknow that he is dead and do not have any Heir, they will take the\nfunds for their personal use, so I don't want such to happen. That is\nwhy I am seeking your co-operation to present you as the Next of Kin /\nHeir to the account, since you bear same last name with the deceased\ncustomer.\nThere is no risk involved; the transaction will be executed under a\nlegitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law\nokay. So It's better that we claim the money, than allowing the Bank\nDirectors to take it, they are rich already. I am not a greedy person,\nso I am suggesting we share the funds in this ratio, 50%50, i.e.\nequal.\nLet me know your mind on this and please do treat this information\nhighly confidential.\nI will review further information to you as soon as I receive your\npositive response.\nHave a nice day and I anticipating your communication.\nWith Regards,\nRobert Szabados\nEmail: \nrobertszabados@citromail.hu"

        "body": "Hello Robert Szabados,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with such an interesting proposal. I must say, it's quite a coincidence that Mr. Richard and I share the same surname! It's a small world indeed.\n\nI'm sorry to hear about the unfortunate demise of Mr. Richard in the earthquake disaster in Japan. Such natural calamities are truly devastating and my thoughts go out to all those affected.\n\nYour proposal is intriguing, but I have a few questions before we proceed further. Could you please provide more details about how this process would work? How can I be presented as the Next of Kin Heir without any legal complications?\n\nAlso, could you tell me more about your relationship with Mr. Richard? How long were you friends and how did you come to know each other?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nGloria"
