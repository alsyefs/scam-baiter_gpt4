        "body": "Dear Ann.\r\n\r\nThank you for responding to my ealy message regarding your transaction.\r\n\r\nTo answer your question on the possibility of securing a high court\r\nperpetual injunction, well it's a court standing order to compel government\r\nagencies or officials to follow rules and regulation.\r\n\r\nThe court perpetual injunction, will  be obtained from a district court and\r\nit's a court standing order that MUST be obeyed by all parties involved\r\nbecause nobody is above the law.\r\n\r\nAnd what I mean by corruption has eaten deep into the system is that most\r\ngovernment agencies and officials are corrupt and dishonest and they take\r\nadvantage of innocent people for their selfish interest.\r\n\r\nAnd also note that court perpetual injunction is also known as permanent\r\ncourt order and immediately we obtain it from the district court, then all\r\ngovernment agencies, officials and paying banks will be compelled by LAW to\r\ndeduct all officials transfer fees, clearance charges and taxes from the\r\nprincipal amount before transferring your funds to your bank account.\r\n\r\nI look forward to finalizing this transaction soon.\r\nRegards.\r\nMr. Roland."
