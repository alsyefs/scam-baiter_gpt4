Well,  the only way you can\nclaim your funds without paying from your pocket again, is by securing\na high court perpetual injunction that will compel all these\ngovernment corrupt  agencies  and officials to DEDUCT all their fees,\nclearance charges and taxes from your funds.\nPlease note, because  corruption has  eaten deep into the system and\nthose corrupt officials operating the system will make it difficult\nfor you to CLAIM your funds due their interest in your funds.\nFinaly, \nif you are able to secure COURT perpetual injunction, then you\nwill be empowered  under the LAW to request that ALL GOVERNMENT\nAGENCIES deduct all their legal fees, clearance charges and taxes from\nyour funds without demanding fees from your hard own money.\nI will help you if you are still willing, able and interested to CLAIM\nyour funds and READY to ADHERE to my directives.\nRegards.\nMr. Peter Roland Eze.\nrolandeze000@gmail.com"

        "body": "Hello Mr. Peter Roland Eze,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with this information. It's quite interesting to hear about the possibility of securing a high court perpetual injunction. I must admit, I'm not very familiar with legal terms and procedures.\n\nCould you please explain more about what a high court perpetual injunction is? And how would one go about securing it? \n\nAlso, could you clarify what you mean by \"corruption has eaten deep into the system\"? Are there specific instances or examples that you could share?\n\nI appreciate your help and look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nAnn"
