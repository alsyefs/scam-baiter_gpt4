I can't even begin to imagine what you're going through right now.\n\nYou mentioned a security firm outside Marinka city in Donetsk where your family fortune is deposited. Could you tell me more about this? How did your husband manage to do that amidst all the chaos?\n\nAlso, how do you plan on getting your grandchild out of there? Do you have any specific plans or ideas in mind?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nAnn"
