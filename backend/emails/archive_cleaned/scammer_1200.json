I'm sure it's a big task for the Task Force Committee on Contract Payment.\n\nCould you please elaborate more on how these changes will affect me? And what exactly is my role in this new process? \n\nAlso, could you clarify what you mean by \"anyway you feel will make you in the receipt of your fund is okay by us\"? I'm not quite sure I understand that part.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nDenise"
