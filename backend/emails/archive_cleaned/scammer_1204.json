I'm glad that despite the challenges we faced, you still remember my efforts to assist you.\n\nI have a few questions though, if you don't mind. Could you please tell me more about these investment projects? They sound fascinating! And how did you meet your new partner from Paraguay?\n\nAlso, regarding the ATM VISA CARD that Issa Yacouba will send me, could you provide more details? How does it work exactly? \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nJames"
