I'm a bit confused though, could you please explain how the United Nations and World Bank came to select me for this? \n\nAlso, I'm not very familiar with online banking. Could you provide more details on how this online bank account will work? How can I ensure that it's secure?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nKaren"
