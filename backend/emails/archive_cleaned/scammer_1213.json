        "body": "Greetings!\nI am Mrs. Sarah Williams, From Canada ,now undergoing medical treatment. Please, I do not have a formal relationship with you but because of my present predicament and circumstances I am made to contact you.\nI am married to Dr Johnson Williams. who was a successful Businessman, and Real Estate owner before he died in the year 2010.\nWe were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days.Before his death we were both born again Christians. I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home, which the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of € 7,983,500.00 , this money is still with the Bank.\nRecently, my Doctor told me that I would not Last long due to cancer and what disturbs me most is my stroke. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to church or an individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here.\nI want a church or individual that will use this money to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the word Of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. I took this decision because I don’t have any child that will inherit this money.\nI cannot rely on family and closest relatives any more, as they did not show responsible behavior when I entrusted part of my wealth to them to distribute to charitable organizations but instead used the money for their personal needs.I sincerely request for your assistance in this humanitarian work.\nThe 40% of the fund is for you and your family, if you will accept to do this humanitarian work. You promised me that you will not disappoint me when the fund will be transferred to your bank account there in your country, and you will also assure me that you will use the 60% of the money for the said purpose.\nHowever, in regards to the project I want to let you know that there are documents that will be required in this transaction process, and those documents are the Bank’s pre-requisite from you as the next of kin claimant. The documents are as follows; POWER OF ATTORNEY FROM ME AS MY NEXT OF KIN BENEFICIARY, DEPOSIT CERTIFICATE OF THE SAID FUNDS. I will provide all these documents to you.\nReply to me urgently if you are interested in this transaction because any delay to your response will give me a room to look for another reliable person for the same purpose, .Please, if you can do this job sincerely and use this fund for what I asked for, Kindly send me your details below .\nYour Full Name................\nYour Age......................\nYour Country..................\nYour Occupation...............\nyour contact Address..........\nyour Telephone Number.........\nOnce I get your reply, I will start all necessary procedures so as to enable you to have possession of my funds as soon as possible before my next surgical operations. I will also issue you a letter of authority which will prove that you are the new beneficiary of this funds, and the documents concerning the deposit.\nWhatever the case might be, just put me in prayers at all times.\nMay the almighty God bless you.\nReply me Back at:( \nsarah202@vivaldi.net\n)"
