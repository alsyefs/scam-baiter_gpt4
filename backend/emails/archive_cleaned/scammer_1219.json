Could you please provide more details about this situation? I'm here to help and would like to understand better.\n\nRemember, it's important to be patient when dealing with financial transactions as they can sometimes take longer than expected due to various reasons such as bank processing times or international transfers.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nRoger"
