However, I would like to clarify a few things before proceeding with the loan application. \n\nFirstly, could you please provide more information about the terms and conditions of the loan? Specifically, I am interested in knowing the interest rate, repayment period, and any additional fees that may be associated with the loan.\n\nSecondly, could you please explain why you need a copy of my ID document and bank statement? I understand that these documents are typically required for credit checks, but I would appreciate if you could confirm this.\n\nLastly, could you please provide your company's physical address and contact number? This is for my personal records and to ensure that I am dealing with a legitimate business.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nAnna"
