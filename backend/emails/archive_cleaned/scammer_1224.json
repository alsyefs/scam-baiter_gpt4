        "body": "Hello Mrs. Janet Louise Yellen,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I am quite surprised to hear about these United Nation funds of Ten Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars. It's a lot of money and I can't recall any involvement with the United Nations that would warrant such a sum.\n\nCould you please provide more details about this? How did my name come up in relation to these funds? And what exactly is this United Nation TAG number you mentioned?\n\nAlso, could you explain why there is a fee involved? I'm not very familiar with these processes, so your clarification would be greatly appreciated.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nCheryl"
