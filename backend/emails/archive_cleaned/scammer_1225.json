It's quite surprising to hear about the Barclays bank using my approved funds in such a manner.\n\nCould you please elaborate more on this? How did the bank get access to these funds and why was I not informed about it earlier? Also, could you explain what you mean by 'funds release processing fee'? \n\nI'm eager to understand more about this situation and how we can resolve it. Looking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nDeloris"
