        "body": "Hello Sen. Uba Sani,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with this information. It's quite surprising to hear about the accrued interest on a contract sum. I must admit, I don't recall having any contracts with the Federal Government of Nigeria.\n\nCould you please provide more details about this contract? When was it initiated and what was its purpose? Also, how did my name get associated with it?\n\nI'm looking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nCharles"
