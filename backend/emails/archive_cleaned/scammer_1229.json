Could you please provide more details about this abandoned shipment? \n\nI would like to know why the consignee declared it as personal effects instead of money, and what are the implications of this misdeclaration? Also, what is the exact amount of money found in the Metal Trunk Box?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nIsrael"
