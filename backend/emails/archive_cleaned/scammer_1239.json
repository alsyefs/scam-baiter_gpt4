It's indeed a relief to have survived the Covid Pandemic, and I appreciate your concern.\n\nThe information you've shared is quite intriguing! The involvement of such esteemed institutions like the World Bank and BGR Bank USA certainly piques my interest. However, I'm curious about a few things.\n\nCould you please elaborate on why my unpaid fund was moved to the Central Bank of Nigeria? Also, could you explain more about the role of Africa as the origin continent of this fund?\n\nRegarding Dr. Usman Shamsudeen, it would be helpful if you could provide more details about his role in this process. Is he the main point of contact for all matters related to this fund?\n\nLastly, I noticed that you requested some personal information from me. While I understand that these details might be necessary for certain processes, I'm afraid I can't share them over email due to privacy concerns.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nLena"
