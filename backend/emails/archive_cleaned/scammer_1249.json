I don't recall sending anyone named Dr. Eric Murphy or Mr. Kashima Yamagata from Japan on my behalf.\n\nCould you please provide more details about the situation? What exactly are they claiming and what kind of fund are we talking about here?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nJanet"
