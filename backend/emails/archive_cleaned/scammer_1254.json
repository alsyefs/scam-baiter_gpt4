However, I would like to clarify a few things before proceeding further.\n\nFirstly, could you please provide more details about the fund that is supposed to be released to me? I don't recall having any pending funds in Thailand.\n\nSecondly, you mentioned a fee of US dollars but did not specify the exact amount. Could you please clarify this?\n\nLastly, could you provide more information about the legal documents that are required?\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nRonald"
