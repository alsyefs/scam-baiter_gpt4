        "body": "Hello Mr. Calton Richard,\n\nThank you for your prompt response and the detailed information about the account setup process. I appreciate your understanding of my location situation, being in South Africa.\n\nI have a few questions though, if you don't mind. Could you please explain more about what a fiduciary account is? And how does making an initial deposit activate my account?\n\nAlso, could you provide more details about the safety deposit box where my late brother's funds are currently held? Is it possible to get some sort of confirmation or proof that the funds are indeed there?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nBessie"
