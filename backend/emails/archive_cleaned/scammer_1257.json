I appreciate your efforts in making this process as smooth as possible. \n\nI am intrigued by the three options you've mentioned. Could you please provide more details about each one? For instance, how does the transfer ktt work? And what are the procedures involved in diplomatic delivery and ATM card payment?\n\nAs for my personal information, I hope you understand that due to privacy concerns, I prefer not to share my telephone number or passport copy over email. However, rest assured that I am genuinely interested in proceeding with this.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nPeter"
