It's quite interesting to hear about the agreement signed in Ukraine and the involvement of the United Nations Board of Auditors and the World Bank auditors. \n\nCould you please provide more details about this process? How does it work exactly? And what role does the German legal department play in all of this?\n\nI'm also curious about how these funds are distributed. Is there a specific criteria or selection process involved?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nChristopher"
