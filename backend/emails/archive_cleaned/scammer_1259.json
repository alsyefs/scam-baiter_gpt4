I have been a successful\nbusinessman for the past 20 years, my business interests has spanned\nthe sectors of metals, oil and precious stones in\nAsia, Africa and Europe, during this time, I have amassed a lot of\nwealth but recently I was diagnosed with esophageal cancer. It has\ndefiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only\nabout a few weeks to live. I am very rich, but was never\ngenerous; I have given most of my assets to my immediate family\nmembers but my mind is not at peace since I have a dream of giving\nback to the society and helping the needy in our world.I have decided\nto give alms and donations to charity organizations.I cannot do this\nmyself anymore because of my health. I once asked members of my family\nto give some money to charity organizations,they refused and kept the\nmoney for themselves that made my\nhealth heavy and uneasy. I have a huge cash deposit in a\nsecured bank since 2011. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and\ndispatch it to charity organizations for charity work under your supervision.\nYou will take out 30% of these funds for your assistance.

However, I would suggest contacting a reputable charity organization directly or perhaps a lawyer who can assist with the distribution of your assets according to your wishes.\n\nWishing you peace and comfort during this difficult time.\n\nBest wishes,\nWayne"
