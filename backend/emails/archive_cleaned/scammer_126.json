        "body": "Hello Mark,\n\nThank you for reaching out and informing me about this situation. I must say, it's quite surprising to hear that my name was among those scammed as listed by the Benin Financial Unit BFIU. \n\nI'm a bit confused about some parts of your message though. Could you please clarify what exactly the \"demand of the conveyance\" is? Also, could you explain more about how the use of Benin Country was abolished due to activities noticed in courier services?\n\nYou mentioned something about buying a card steam wallet or sephora gift card. How does this relate to my situation? \n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nClyde"
