I have not authorized anyone to claim any funds on my behalf, nor am I currently residing in a nursing home. \n\nCould you please provide more details about the fund you're referring to? Also, could you clarify who this woman is and what exactly she has told you?\n\nThank you for bringing this matter to my attention.\n\nBest wishes,\nRonald"
