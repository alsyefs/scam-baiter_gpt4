Anthony Blair, my late husband was from UK, who worked with Shell Oil Company in United States for Twenty-Six years before he died in the year 2017 after a brief illness that lasted only five days. Following my ill health (Cancer of the Lungs), my doctor told me that I may not live longer than required due to my health condition. I am looking forward to someone who I can entrust my husband's money to use for charitable works. More details will be made known to you upon your response.\nThank you,\nMay God Bless\nLady Blair.
