Could you please provide more details on how you plan to carry out this operation? \n\nAlso, could you clarify what percentage of the total recovered funds will be taken as a fee for your services? Your previous message was not clear on this point.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nPhillip"
