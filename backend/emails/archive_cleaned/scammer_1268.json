I don't recall having any dealings with the individuals you mentioned - Emerah, Willie, Rev Godwin Peter, Mr Christ Herbert and Mr Mattew.\n\nI'm afraid there might be some misunderstanding here. Could you please provide more details about this case? What exactly is it about? And how am I involved in it?\n\nAlso, could you clarify what funds are we talking about? I don't remember expecting any funds from anyone.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nAlice"
