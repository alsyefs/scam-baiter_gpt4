I am excited about this opportunity and look forward to proceeding with the transfer.\n\nHowever, before we proceed, I would like to clarify a few things:\n\n1. You mentioned that I need to pay a sum of money for obtaining necessary documents. Could you please specify the exact amount?\n\n2. You suggested making this payment via Google Play Card or Steam Wallet Gift Card purchased from Walmart or CVS Pharmacy. This is an unusual method of payment for such transactions, could you please explain why this method has been chosen?\n\n3. Regarding the options for receiving my money, could you please provide more details on each option and their respective charge rates?\n\n4. Lastly, if I choose to open an online bank account with your bank, what would be the process and cost involved?\n\nI appreciate your assistance in this matter and look forward to your prompt response.\n\nBest wishes,\nFernando"
