When was it held and how was my name selected?\n\nI understand that you need some form of ID for verification, but I'm a bit hesitant to share such sensitive information over email. Is there any other way we can verify my identity without sharing personal documents?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nBlair"
