I must say, it's not every day that one receives news of such a large sum! \n\nI'm curious though, how did the United Nations and World Bank come to select me for this? And could you please explain more about this online bank account that will be opened in my name? How does it work exactly?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest wishes,\nChristopher"
