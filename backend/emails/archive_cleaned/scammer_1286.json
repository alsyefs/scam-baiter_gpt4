I have no idea who Mr. Albert Hill is, nor have I given anyone power of attorney over my affairs. \n\nThis is a clear case of attempted fraud and identity theft. I would appreciate it if you could provide me with any additional information about this Mr. Hill and the claims he has made.\n\nThank you for bringing this matter to my attention.\n\nBest wishes,\nPauline"
