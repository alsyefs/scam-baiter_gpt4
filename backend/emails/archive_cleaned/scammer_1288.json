        "body": "Dear Dr. Ben Bola,\n\nThank you for your email and the good news about the fund transfer. I am ready to proceed with this but I need some clarifications.\n\nFirstly, could you please explain why there is a charge for COST OF TRANSFER? As far as I know, bank transfers are usually free of charge or incur a very minimal fee. Why is it different in this case?\n\nSecondly, could you provide more details about this fund? How did it come about and why has it been approved for me?\n\nLastly, I would like to know more about the security measures in place to ensure that my personal information will be safe once I provide them.\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest regards,\nLewis D.\n\nBest wishes,\nMichael"
