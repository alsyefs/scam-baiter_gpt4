I reside here in Silver Springs Florida. My residential address is as follows. 7008 B Hwy 326 Silver Springs Florida 34488, United States, am thinking of relocating since I am now rich. I am one of those that took part in the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Compensation in Nigeria many years ago and they refused to pay me, I had paid over US$20,000 while in the US, trying to get my payment all to no avail.\n \nSo I decided to travel down to Nigeria with all my compensation documents, And I was directed to meet Barrister George Alex, who is the member of The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC)  COMPENSATION AWARD COMMITTEE, And I contacted him and he explained everything to me. He said whoever is contacting us through emails are fake.\n \nHe took me to the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC)  paying bank for the claim of my Compensation payment. Right now I am the most happiest woman on earth because I have received my compensation funds of $18,500,000.00  US Dollars, Moreover Barrister George Alex showed me the full information of those that are yet to receive their payments and I saw your email address as one of the beneficiaries, that is why I decided to email you to stop dealing with those people, they are not with your fund, they are only making money out of you. I will advise you to contact Barrister George Alex.\n \nYou have to contact him directly on this information below.\n \nNNPC COMPENSATION AWARD HOUSE\nName : Barrister George Alex(Esq)\nEmail:  \nbargeorgealex009@hotmail.com\nTelephone; +2348085435198\n \nYou really have to stop dealing with those people that are contacting you and telling you that your fund is with them, it is not in anyway with them, They are only taking advantage of you and they will dry you up until you have nothing.\n \nThe only money I paid after I met Barrister George Alex was just US$570  for the paper works, Take note of that.\n \nAs soon as you contact him he will send you the payment information which you are to use in sending the payment to him in order for him to obtain the document from the court of law there in Nigeria so that your fund can be transfer to you without any delay just the way mine was being transfer to me.\n \nSend him the following details if you know you are ready to have your FUNDS so that as soon as he receive your information he will send to you the payment details for sending him the $570 USD that is needed for him to get the document that is needed to make the transfer a successful one and that is that only payment i made to Barrister George Alex and he help me in the transferring of my FUNDS and i most say that you have to contact him so that he will help you the way he help me to Get my FUNDS without any further payment.\n \nFill Out your  information's  to him if you are ready to get your FUNDS\n \nYour Full Name:...............\nDirect Phone:....................\nCountry.................\nOccupation:.....................\nGender:.........\nAge:..............\n \nOnce again stop contacting those people, I will advise you to contact Barrister George Alex so that he can help you to Deliver your $18,500,000.00 US Dollars instead of dealing with those liars that will be turning you around asking for different kind of money to complete your transaction.\n \nThank You and Be Blessed.\n \nMrs Connie Dutton.\n7008 B Hwy 326 Silver Springs\nFLorida 34488, United States   "
