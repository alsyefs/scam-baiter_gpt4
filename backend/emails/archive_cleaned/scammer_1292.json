Have you had personal experiences that shaped this belief?\n\nAlso, when you mention 'greed', could you elaborate on what exactly you mean by that? Are we talking about financial greed or something else entirely?\n\nI look forward to hearing more from you and understanding your viewpoint better.\n\nBest wishes,\nVictoria"
