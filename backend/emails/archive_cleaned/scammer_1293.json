        "body": "Hello Mr. Tian Huiyu,\n\nThank you for your email and the information about the Bitcoin money transfer system. I must admit, this is all very new to me. I've heard of Bitcoin but never really understood how it works.\n\nYou mentioned that my name and Email ID are among those signed to receive a crypto payment from the World Bank China Merchants Bank. That's quite surprising! Could you please explain how my name ended up on this list? \n\nAlso, you mentioned a fee of US $100 for obtaining a bitcoin wire transfer permit. Is this a standard procedure for all bitcoin transactions or is it specific to this particular transaction?\n\nI'm also curious about the process of transferring funds directly to my personal bank account through Bitcoin. How does that work exactly? And what kind of security measures are in place to ensure the safety of these transactions?\n\nLastly, you mentioned something about keeping humanity alive even in the face of great adversity. That sounds like a noble cause! Could you tell me more about it?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nEric"
