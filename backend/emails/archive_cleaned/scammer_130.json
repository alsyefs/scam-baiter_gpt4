        "body": "  Hello\nMy name is Barkev Hagopian and I am one of the assistants of Mr. Bo Li\nthe current Deputy Managing Director of the IMF (The International\nMonetary Fund) here in Washington DC, United States.\nThe reason for my email to you today is to let you know that, unknown\nto the general public, The IMF receives close to a total of US$10\nbillion each year in donations from wealthy philanthropists around the\nworld. Some of the donations are even bestowed anonymously. I am\ncontacting you to let you know that I am in a position to earmark some\nof these funds for disbursement which can fall under the category of\neither low interest loans or humanitarian funding. I wish to use my\ninside knowledge here at the IMF to retain a portion of these funds\nfor myself and that is why I have written to you.\nHere is my proposal:\nIf you have a business that you think would qualify for either a low\ninterest loan or humanitarian assistance please get in touch with me\nupon receiving this email. I would then refer you to the contact that\nwould help you by filling out the exact forms needed and guiding you\nthrough the procedures for you to receive funds anywhere from $5\nmillion to $20 million. You would in effect have an “inside person”\ntelling you exactly how to get funds from The IMF in a fully\nlegitimate way. Most people have no idea how to achieve this, but I\nhave the knowledge and know which strings to pull to make it happen.\nFor my assistance, I would ask that after you receive funding, that\nyou kick back 10% of the funds to me if it is a loan, and 15% of the\nfunds if it is for humanitarian purposes.\nPlease let me know if you are interested and I will call you for a\ndiscussion. It is against protocol to offer anyone this type of\nassistance, so I have written to you from my private email to start. I\ncan give you my official email address at the IMF once we get started.\nIf I do not hear back from you in the next 5 business days I will\nassume you are not interested and I will continue my search for\nsomeone who is. However if you are interested, please send me your\ndirect phone number so that we can speak.\nHoping to hear from you.\nBarkev Hagopian   "

I must say, it's not every day that one receives an email from someone associated with the IMF! \n\nI'm curious about this process.
