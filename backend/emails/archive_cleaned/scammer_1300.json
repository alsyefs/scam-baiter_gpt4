I must apologize if my silence has caused any inconvenience, it was not intentional.\n\nRegarding your email, I'm a bit confused about the process you've mentioned. Could you please explain more about this Personal Account Form? What is its purpose and how does it affect the transfer of funds?\n\nAlso, could you provide more details about the sending bank? It would be helpful to know their procedures and requirements for such transactions.\n\nI appreciate your patience and look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nMatthew"
