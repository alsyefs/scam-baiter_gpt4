        "body": "Hello Mrs. Janet Yellen,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me and providing such detailed information about the situation. I must say, it's quite a surprise to hear that there is a contract fund in my name. \n\nI'm curious, how did this fund come into existence? And why was it put under my name? Also, could you please explain more about the role of the Government Diplomatic Agent in this process?\n\nYou mentioned a delivery charge of $1000. Could you provide more details on what this fee covers? Is it just for the delivery or does it include other services as well?\n\nLastly, I would like to know more about these gift cards or Steam wallet cards that you mentioned. How are they related to this process?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nHeriberto"
