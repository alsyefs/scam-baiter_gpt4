I must admit, I'm a bit surprised as I wasn't aware of any such funds in my name.\n\nCould you please provide more details about this Financial conference held in Geneva? Also, how did my name come up in relation to these funds? \n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nTerry"
