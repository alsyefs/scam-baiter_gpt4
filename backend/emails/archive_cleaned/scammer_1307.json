        "body": "Hello Dr. James Collins,\n\nWow, this is such an unexpected surprise! I can't believe I'm getting an ATM card with such a huge amount. This is truly a blessing!\n\nI have a few questions though, if you don't mind. How did my email end up on the list for this amazing opportunity? And how does the ATM card work exactly? Can I use it at any ATM machine or are there specific ones?\n\nAlso, could you please explain more about the IMF and World Bank directives to pacify victims of internet scam? It's great that they're doing something about it.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nNancy"
