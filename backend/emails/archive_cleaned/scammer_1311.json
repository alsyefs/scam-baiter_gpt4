A Billionaire from Saudi Arabia has been lured to believe you are dead, and he has forwarded an application and the processing is currently being pursued vigorously with his influence, money and connections.\nThis is in fulfillment of the promise made to the whole Foreign Beneficiaries during the just concluded World Economic Summit, in Zurich-Switzerland, that every Beneficiary will receive his/her outstanding fund without further delay from VP Bank of Switzerland Group.\nAs I write, all approvals associated with the processing and release of this fund to the Post Finance Bank account in VP BANK OF SWITZERLAND have been completed. So, you MUST stop deflating this move by immediately writing to the paying authority that you are still alive and well as against the lies told by the Saudi Billionaire and his cohorts. Do not doubt this information nor treat it with contempt.\nYou will get to know more about this upon your response because I shall give you all available hidden information as far as I know. I await your urgent reaction to this so I can give you details and the right office to contact in order to swiftly foil this fraud.\nWe will consciously appreciate your response and stand towards this matter of immediate attention.\nHelp us fight Scam and Terrorism off the face of the earth.\nWe anticipate your immediate response.\nRegards \n \n \n \nSecretary Mayorkas Official Photo.jpg\nAlejandro Mayorkas (Honorable)\nUnited States Secretary of Homeland Security   "

I must say, it's quite a surprise to hear that someone is trying to steal my contract fund under the false report of my demise. \n\nCould you please provide more details about this situation? Who is this person from Saudi Arabia and how did they come to believe that I'm no longer alive? Also, could you explain more about the World Economic Summit promise and how it relates to my case?\n\nI look forward to your response and further instructions on how to proceed with this matter.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nChristopher"
