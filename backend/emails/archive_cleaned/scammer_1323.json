It's not every day that one gets an email from an ambassador! \n\nI have a few questions though, if you don't mind me asking. Could you please tell me more about the contract and how it accrued interest? Also, could you explain why my package needs to be registered as an ambassadorial package?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nDelmer"
