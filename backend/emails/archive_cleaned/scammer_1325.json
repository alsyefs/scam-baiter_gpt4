I must say, it's a bit unexpected! \n\nCould you please provide me with more information? For instance, how did my name come up in your database? And what is the purpose of this payment?\n\nI'm also curious about the United Nations Economic and Social Council ECOSOC and their role in this process. Could you explain a bit more about their involvement?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nJackie"
