However, I must admit that I found it quite difficult to understand due to the formatting and language used.\n\nFrom what I could gather, it seems you are asking for a payment of US dollars for statutory transfer clearing validation charges. Could you please clarify this? Also, could you provide more information about the total sum that is supposed to be transferred?\n\nI would appreciate if you could resend the information in a clearer format.\n\nBest wishes,\nJeanne"
