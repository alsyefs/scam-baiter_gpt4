I must say, it's quite a surprise to hear about this unsettled fund claim in Africa. \n\nI'm curious, how did my name come up in relation to these funds? And could you please explain more about the role of the World Bank Review Committee in this process?\n\nAlso, I would like to know more about the United Bank for Africa (UBA) Ghana. How will they be handling the transfer of these funds? \n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nBobbi"
