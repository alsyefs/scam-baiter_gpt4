It's quite surprising to hear about this compensation from the United Nations, I wasn't aware of such a program.\n\nI'm curious, how did my email address end up on the list of people who were scammed? Also, could you please provide more details about this ATM Master Card? How does it work exactly?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nStephen"
