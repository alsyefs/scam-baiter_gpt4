        "body": "Hello Mrs. Rita Allen,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me from the Postal Shipping Office USA. I'm quite surprised to hear about this ATM Card Parcel containing a million United States Dollars. It's not every day that one receives such news!\n\nI understand that you need my full name and delivery details for the process. However, before we proceed, could you please provide more information about how this parcel came into existence? How was it determined that I am the rightful owner of this parcel?\n\nAlso, you mentioned something about a Delivery Approval File Renewal Fee. Could you explain what this fee is for and why it is necessary? \n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nPamela"
