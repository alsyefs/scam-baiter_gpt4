        "body": "Hello Mr. Antonio Guterres,\n\nThank you for your detailed message. It's quite an interesting situation, I must say! I'm a bit confused though, could you please explain more about this ATM card? How does it work exactly? \n\nAlso, you mentioned that the ATM card is labeled as non-fragmented bond and is protected by hardcover bond policy by the auditors. Could you elaborate on what this means?\n\nI'm also curious about the delivery process. You mentioned that my million dollars ATM card will leave to my destination first thing tomorrow morning if the delivery fee is received today. How can I be sure that it will arrive safely?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest wishes,\nAnn"
