        "body": "Dear Harrison Albert,\n\nThank you for your email. I am doing well and my family is also in good health. I appreciate your concern.\n\nI must admit, I was surprised to receive your email as I have not been a victim of any scams or fraudulent activities. However, I am glad to hear that the United Nations is taking action against such activities and compensating victims.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, since I have not been a victim of any scams, there are no payments made to scammers or any unfinished businesses due to government problems. Therefore, there are no details that I can provide you with.\n\nI commend the efforts of the United Nations in making the world a better place and dealing with worldwide scammers. Please continue with this noble work.\n\nBest wishes,\nWilfred"
