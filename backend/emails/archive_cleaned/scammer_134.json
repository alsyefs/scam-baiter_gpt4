        "body": "Dear Barr. Adanson Hilbert,\n\nThank you for your detailed explanation. It's quite an interesting situation, isn't it? I must admit, I'm not very familiar with these kinds of matters, but I'm eager to learn more.\n\nYou mentioned that the money is currently in a Security Company. Could you tell me more about this company? How does it work and what kind of security measures do they have in place?\n\nAlso, you said that we will need to process some documents on my name as the next of kin. What kind of documents are these exactly? And how long does this process usually take?\n\nI'm sorry for all the questions, but as I said before, this is all new to me and I want to make sure I understand everything correctly.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nAmy"
