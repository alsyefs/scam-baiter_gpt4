        "body": "Hello there,\n\nThank you for reaching out and providing such detailed information about the delivery process. I must say, it's quite interesting to learn about all these procedures that go into delivering a package.\n\nI'm curious though, why is the insurance fee being paid through a gift card or steam wallet card? Is this a common practice in your company? \n\nAlso, could you please explain more about what this insurance document is and why it's so important for the delivery of my package?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nKimberly"
