However, I am a bit confused about the security keeping fee. Could you please clarify how much this fee is and how it should be paid?\n\nAlso, could you please provide me with the contact details of the UPS Express Customer Service? You mentioned in your email that I should contact them but did not provide their contact information.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nAshley"
