It's really kind of the US government to do this. \n\nCould you please tell me more about how this happened? How did they find out that I was a victim? And how did they decide on the amount to be transferred?\n\nI'm also curious about the process of transferring or delivering the money. Could you explain it in more detail?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nThomas"
