I am surprised to hear about this situation as I was not expecting any funds from Benin Republic. \n\nBefore proceeding, could you please provide more details about the origin of these funds and why they are being sent to me? Also, could you clarify why the payment for the security keeping fee is requested in Itune card or Steam wallet? This seems unusual for an official transaction.\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nBarbara"
