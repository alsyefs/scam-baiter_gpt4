Could you please tell me more about why these funds are being released to me? And how did they come to choose me for this?\n\nI'm also curious about the process. How does it work exactly? Will there be any paperwork that I need to fill out or sign?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nJerry"
