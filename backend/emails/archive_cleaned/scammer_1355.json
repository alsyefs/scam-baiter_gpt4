        "body": "Hello Mr. Robert C. Matt,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me and providing such detailed information about the transfer process. I must say, it's quite a lot to take in at once! \n\nI'm curious about the different options you've mentioned for receiving my money - ATM Card Delivery, Cashier Check Delivery, Bank to Bank Transfer, and Online Bank Rate. Could you please explain a bit more about each of these? What are their respective charge rates?\n\nAlso, I noticed that you mentioned an apple card as a form of payment for obtaining necessary documents. Is there any specific reason why an apple card is required? \n\nLastly, I'd like to know more about this online account that can be opened on my behalf with your bank. How does it work exactly? And how secure would my funds be in this online account?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nDean"
