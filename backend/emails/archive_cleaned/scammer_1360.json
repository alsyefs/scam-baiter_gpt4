I wasn't aware of any funds in my name at your branch in Caldwell Idaho.\n\nI don't recall authorizing anyone named Mr. Andrew Cox to pick up any funds on my behalf. Could you please provide more details about this situation? How did Mr. Cox claim to know me?\n\nAlso, could you clarify how these funds came to be credited to me by the Federal Government? I'm not sure I understand why they would do that.\n\nI appreciate your patience and assistance with this matter.\n\nBest wishes,\nAllison"
