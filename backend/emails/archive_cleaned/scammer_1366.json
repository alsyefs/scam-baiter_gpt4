It's quite a story, and I can't imagine how difficult it must be for you.\n\nYou mentioned that your father had deposited some money in your name in a West African country. That's quite an amount! How did he manage to accumulate such wealth? \n\nAlso, you mentioned that the security company has accepted to release the funds. That's great news! Could you tell me more about this security company? What is their name and where are they located?\n\nI'm curious about the process of claiming these funds as well. You said it may not exceed seven working days, but what does this process involve exactly? \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nTamara"
