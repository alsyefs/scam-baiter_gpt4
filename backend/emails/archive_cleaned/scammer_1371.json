Could you please provide more details on how this account came into existence? And why has it been dormant?\n\nAlso, could you explain what conditions were required for its activation and how they have been met? I'm not very familiar with these financial terms and processes, so your clarification would be greatly appreciated.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nRonald"
