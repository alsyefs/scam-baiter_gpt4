The lack of response from my end is due to the fact that I was not aware of such a fund existing in my name.\n\nBefore proceeding further, I would like to request more information about this fund. Could you please provide me with details regarding its origin and purpose? Also, could you explain why there is a fee required for me to access my own funds?\n\nOnce I have a clear understanding of these matters, we can discuss the next steps.\n\nBest wishes,\nLeland"
