        "body": "Dear Mr. Simon Mark,\n\nThank you for your email and the information provided. I appreciate your efforts in trying to resolve this issue before your transfer to Germany.\n\nHowever, I would like to clarify a few things before we proceed. Could you please provide more details about the scam incident you mentioned? As far as I'm aware, I haven't been involved in any scams recently.\n\nAlso, could you please explain why an Apple gift card or Steam wallet is required for the activation fee? It seems unusual that a bank would request payment through these methods.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nKevin"
