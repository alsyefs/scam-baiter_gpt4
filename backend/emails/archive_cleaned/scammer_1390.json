        "body": "Dear Charles Plumber, ESQ,\n\nThank you for your prompt response. It's always a pleasure to hear from you. I must admit, I was a bit surprised by your message as well. Life has a funny way of throwing curveballs at us, doesn't it?\n\nI appreciate the information you've provided regarding the documents in question and the role of the office in Rome. It sounds like they have quite an important task ahead of them.\n\nI'm curious though, could you possibly elaborate on what exactly this \"funds release classified document\" is? I'm not very familiar with these types of documents and would love to learn more about them.\n\nAlso, thank you for providing me with Mr. Peter Osborne's contact details. I will certainly reach out to him for further clarification on this matter.\n\nIn the meantime, if there are any other details or pieces of advice that you think might be helpful for me to know, please don't hesitate to share them.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nMerlin"
