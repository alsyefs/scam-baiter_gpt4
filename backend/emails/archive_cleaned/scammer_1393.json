        "body": "Hello Ms. Liza Wong,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with such an interesting proposition. I must say, the story of Mr. Saba Masri is quite tragic and it's a shame that his family hasn't come forward to claim his assets.\n\nI'm curious about how you found me and why you think I would be a good fit for this endeavor? Also, could you please explain more about the process of presenting someone as the next of kin? It sounds like a complex legal procedure.\n\nAs for your request for my personal information, I hope you understand that it's not safe to share such details over email due to privacy concerns. However, I am more than willing to continue our conversation and learn more about this opportunity.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nRobert"
