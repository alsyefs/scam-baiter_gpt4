        "body": "  Dear friend,\nIt is my pleasure to write to you concerning an offer if your interest would be trustworthy. Within the ESKOM South Africa Energy Company where I work as a Director of Audit and Project Implementation, I have in my possession unsettled payment in USD funds. The funds represent a certain percentage of the total contract value executed in my Department by a foreign firm which I over-invoiced to the amount of USD12,700,000.00 (Twelve Million Seven Hundred Thousand United States Dollar). While the actual contract cost has been paid to the original contractor leaving the overbilling amount unspecified and/or uncredited.\nI am seeking your cooperation to present you as the beneficiary of the over-valuation [USD12,700,000.00] since I'm not permitted to operate foreign bank account. Change of beneficiary information upon application for claim to reflect payment in your name will be secured with great supervision and control. I propose that should you be willing to come on board in this project, your share for participation will be (35%), and the remaining(65%) will be for me. The business is completely safe from risk provided you handle it with utmost confidentiality. It does not matter whether you and/or your company does a contract project meaning your area of specialization won't be a hindrance for actualizing this project.\nI have reposed my confidence in you and I hope you won't let me down, thank you for your anticipated cooperation.\nYours sincerely,\nPeter Woodlands   "

        "body": "Dear Delores,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your email, I really appreciate your response to my\r\nproposition.\r\n\r\nThis is to inform you that after a rigorous verification process a verdict\r\nwas reached to grant you the sole beneficiary status and rightfully claim\r\nthe life insurance funds of separate value because the married couples had\r\nindividual life insurance covers for each partner. In furtherance to the\r\nlife insurance inheritance funds, the payment was already made out to the\r\nspouse, because as at the time of her husband’s demise, she was in a coma\r\nfor a few days and later recovered but passed on during the recovery stages\r\nprobably from grief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA very sad tale of the couple and summarizes the reason for this next line\r\nof action regarding this payment. The insurance company already worked out\r\nthe payment to spouse and wrote out a check in her favour and subsequently\r\nvice versa to avoid anomalies with the accounting. However, for this\r\ninsurance payment to be released to a third party outside beneficiary\r\nstatus or official kinship outside the contents of the insurance policy\r\ndocuments, legalization process consisting of Stamp Duty Assessment and\r\nAffidavit Oath respectively. Which must be registered here in England and\r\nunder direct supervision of His Majesty’s High Crown Court, with which I\r\nwill attach the necessary forms in my next email.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Indemnity of Rights Privilege Form is the official\r\ncommunique containing the legality directives regarding this procedure.\r\nTherefore, making it highly imperative that you adhere to these directives\r\nin ensuring the immediate release of this insurance pay out. Furthermore,\r\nthe initial payment issued in the form of bank draft to the deceased wife\r\nprior to her demise was recalled and replaced with an interstate bank draft\r\nissued by the assigned paying bank on behalf of Insurance Company to show\r\nthe funds are still readily available for claim upon compliance with the\r\nlegal directives outlined in this email.\nRegards,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeter Woodlands"
