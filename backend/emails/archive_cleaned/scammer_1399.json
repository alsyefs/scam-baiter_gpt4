Before I proceed, I want to make it clear to you that we decided to stop communication with you in the past because you have always doubted all our words and decided to follow the instructions of African hoodlums and impersonators that you were dealing with, whom are also only interested in extorting money out from you and use you as their prey.\nAnyway, We decided to contact you today to alert you on the status of your fund during our meeting on the round-table with the President of the World Bank in Foreign Matters,  and we were advised to contact you and make sure that your fund gets to you before the closure of the payment system in no distance time, only if you can follow our instructions this time around because some options have been made for you to receive your fund without any more delay. Now the ball is in your court as I have been advised to allow you to choose the way you want your fund to get you which I am going to explain to you as soon as I hear back from you to prove that you are now ready to receive your fund this time around without doubting us again.  Lastly: remember that we are not going to accept any form of delay from you regarding this current transaction because our office has been given 72 hours which is three working days to make sure we conclude this transaction or it will be canceled without any delay\n \nKindly get back to me as soon as you receive this email for further instructions.\n \nThanks for your anticipation and understanding.\n \nYours Sincerely,\nMANAGING DIRECTOR\nCONSULTANT PAYMENT CENTER.\nDAVID MALPASS\nworldbankdaviidmalpass11@gmail.com\n "
