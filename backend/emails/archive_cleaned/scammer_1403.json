I'm curious, could you please explain more about how this project works? \n\nAlso, I'm interested in understanding how my name was selected for this? Was there a specific criteria or process involved?\n\nI noticed that you mentioned something about a fee of an Apple gift card or Steam wallet Card. Could you clarify why these specific types of payment are required?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest wishes,\nJudith"
