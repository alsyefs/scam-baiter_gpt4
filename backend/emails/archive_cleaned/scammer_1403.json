        "body": "Hello Mr. James Ego,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me and informing me about this opportunity. It's quite surprising to hear about the United Nations mass assisted project. I'm curious, could you please explain more about how this project works? \n\nAlso, I'm interested in understanding how my name was selected for this? Was there a specific criteria or process involved?\n\nI noticed that you mentioned something about a fee of an Apple gift card or Steam wallet Card. Could you clarify why these specific types of payment are required?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest wishes,\nJudith"
