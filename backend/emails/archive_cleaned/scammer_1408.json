Could you please tell me more about what's inside the box? And why has it been in your office for over a month?\n\nAlso, could you clarify what you mean by \"fiscal Cash payment\"? Is this some sort of special payment method? \n\nI'm also curious about Mr. James Floyd, the delivery agent. How long has he been working with your company? \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nAnthony"
