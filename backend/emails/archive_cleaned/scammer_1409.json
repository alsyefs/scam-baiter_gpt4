It must be a difficult time for your community at All Saint Catholic Church.\n\nI'm quite surprised to receive this message, as I don't recall ever meeting or communicating with Rev. Sister Tracy Jones. Could you please provide more details on how she came across my email address? And why would she choose me, a complete stranger, as the beneficiary of her will?\n\nAlso, could you tell me more about Rev. Sister Tracy Jones? What kind of person was she? How did she serve in your church?\n\nThank you and God bless.\n\nBest wishes,\nKayla"
