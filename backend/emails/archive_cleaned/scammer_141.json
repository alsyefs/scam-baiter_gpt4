I'm glad to hear that you were finally able to receive your funds with the help of Barrister Antonio Guterres.\n\nI'm curious, how did you come across Barrister Antonio Guterres in the first place? And what made you decide to trust him after all the trouble you had been through?\n\nAlso, could you tell me more about these paper works that cost money? What kind of documents were they and why were they necessary?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nJeff"
