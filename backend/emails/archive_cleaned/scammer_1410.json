AGANGA.\nSPECIAL ADVISER TO\nCENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA & FORMER\nMINISTER OF INDUSTRY,TRADE AND INVESTMENT\nFOREIGN FUND RELEASE DEPARTMENT.\nCBN/FGN/IMF/01/2023.\nATTENTION: BENEFICIARY,\nThis message should not be a coincident to you but a matter of fact as we\ncommunicate with you base on the last meeting between our President\nMuhammadu Buhari, and the new UN Secretary-General, Ant√≥nio Guterres,\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) ,World Bank and World Health Organization\n(WHO). The outcome of the meeting is how to release the pending funds\nbelonging to all beneficiaries /contractors who have waited for the past\nyears and applied every effort to receive their benefited fund which have\nproven abortive. We have been working on this issue since October 2022 but\ncould not be reached until now.\nBut the new condition agreed by our President is that he should cooperate\nwith the Organization involved to ensure that every beneficiary who have\nnot receive any of there pending payment do what is required immediately\nand for every person involve to receive his/her fund  base on this period\nof PANDEMIC COVID-19 so that they can use there fund to help the sick\naround them and save the life of may people affected. And this condition\nwas given to our Country based on the several loans they are receiving from\nthe World Bank and through the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  to save\nour own country.\nSo far our dear President has received the sum of US$78 Billion Dollars\nfrom the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) as support to\nsave our nation. But they want our own government to do the same by\nreleasing the pending fund to every beneficiary that complies with our\ngovernment to ensure that he/she is paid legally.  The Federal Government\nof Nigeria has giving Central Bank of Nigeria the last order to pay any\nbeneficiary /contractors who comply to obtain the required documents needed\nfor the release of his/her fund into the beneficiary account or set up an\nonline account in favor of the beneficiary.\nBut we are surprise that after the last meeting between Presidential\nAdvisory Council and Central Bank New Committee; we discovered that our\nDirector ,Corporate Communications department has received account details\nfrom one Rev. Lawrence R. Larson from United States claiming that you\ninstructed him to receive your own approved fund on your behalf as your\nNEXT OF KIN with reason that you are been affected by COVID-19 and you\ndon't think you will survive and will not be able to follow up your\ntransaction. We received an e-mail together with his account information\nbelow; but we have refused to act on this information without an authorized\ndocument signed by you, please if you're alive, can you quickly return this\nmessage and confirm if this information is true or false.\nAccount Name: Rev. Lawrence R. Larson, D.Th.\nName of Bank: MERCANTILE BANK FLORIDA\nAddress: 11250 S.W. 93rd Court Road, Suite 700,\nOcala, Florida 34481\nSwift Code: CFBKUS33\nRouting Number: 063113772\nAccount Number: 8602516626\nKindly reconfirm to us with this information below as proof that we are\ndealing with the right person and you have not sent Rev. Lawrence R.\nLarson, to claim your fund as your NEXT OF KIN because we are ready to work\non your payment based on the instruction we receive. (1)YOUR FULL NAME,\n(2)AGE (3)OCCUPATION (4).

        "body": "Hello O. Aganga,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, your message is quite intriguing and it's a lot to take in. I'm not sure how my name got involved in this matter, but it seems like there's been some sort of mix-up.\n\nI don't recall instructing anyone named Rev. Lawrence R. Larson to receive any funds on my behalf. I'm also not aware of any approved fund that should be coming my way.\n\nCould you please provide more details about this fund? How did it come about and why is it being directed towards me? Also, could you clarify the role of the Central Bank of Nigeria in this process?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nRonald"
