However, I would like to clarify a few things before proceeding further. \n\n1) You mentioned that my fund worth USD has been approved, but the exact amount is not specified in the email. Could you please confirm the exact amount?\n\n2) You asked me to forward some information, but it's not clear what specific information you need from me.\n\n3) Lastly, could you provide more details about the ATM Card Payment process? How does it work and how can I ensure its safety and security?\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nValerie"
