        "body": "Hello Barrister Kojo Esq,\n\nThank you for reaching out and sharing this information with me. It's quite a situation, isn't it? I must say, the details are a bit overwhelming.\n\nI'm curious about the process you've described. Could you perhaps explain more about how these funds were discovered? And why is it that they can't be returned to Africa?\n\nAlso, could you clarify what exactly the Payment Permit Consent Release Order is? How does one go about obtaining such a document?\n\nLastly, I'm not sure I understand why my personal details would be needed to prove ownership of my email. Could you elaborate on this point?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nLinda"
