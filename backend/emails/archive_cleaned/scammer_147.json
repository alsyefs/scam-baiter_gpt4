It's interesting to hear about the decisions made by the Central Bank of Nigeria and President Muhammadu Buhari. \n\nCould you please explain more about how my name ended up on this list? And what exactly does it mean that these funds are \"unclaimed\"? \n\nAlso, could you clarify what you mean by \"crediting fees\"? How much would that be?\n\nI'm sorry for all the questions, but I just want to make sure I understand everything correctly.\n\nLooking forward to your response!\n\nBest wishes,\nRose"
