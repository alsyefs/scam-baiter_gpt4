        "body": "Mr. Abderazack Zebdani!\nGood day, Please permit me to introduce myself, My name is Mr.\nAbderazack Zebdani, From Burkina Faso, I work in Bank Of Africa (BOA)\nas Telex Manager, please see this as a confidential message and do not\nreveal it to another person and let me know whether you can be of\nassistance regarding my proposal below because it is top secret.\nNevertheless, I want you to understand that there are still genuine\nand legitimate business class persons in the internet world today so I\nam assuring you that this transaction is 100% genuine.\nI am about to retire from active Banking service to start a new life\nbut I am skeptical to reveal this particular secret to a stranger. You\nmust assure me that everything will be handled confidentially because\nwe are not going to suffer again in life. It has been 10 years now\nthat most of the greedy African Politicians used our bank to launder\nmoney overseas through the help of their Political advisers. Most of\nthe funds which they transferred out of the shores of Africa were gold\nand oil money that was supposed to have been used to develop the\ncontinent. Their Political advisers always inflated the amounts before\ntransferring to foreign accounts, so I also used the opportunity to\ndivert part of the funds hence I am aware that there is no official\ntrace of how much was transferred as all the accounts used for such\ntransfers were being closed after transfer. I acted as the Bank\nOfficer to most of the politicians and when I discovered that they\nwere using me to succeed in their greedy act; I also cleaned some of\ntheir banking records from the Bank files and no one cared to ask me\nbecause the money was too much for them to control. They laundered\nover $5billion Dollars during the process.\nBefore I send this message to you, I have already diverted\n($10.5million Dollars) to an escrow account belonging to no one in the\nbank.The bank is anxious now to know who the beneficiary to the funds\nis, because they have made a lot of profits with the funds. It is more\nthan Eight years now, I donâ€™t want to retire from the bank without\ntransferring the funds to a foreign account, I only want you to assist\nme by providing a reliable bank account where the funds can be\ntransferred. The money will be shared 60% for me and 40% for you.\nThere is no one coming to ask you about the funds because I secured\neverything.\nYou are not to face any difficulties or legal implications as I am\ngoing to handle the transfer personally. If you are capable of\nreceiving the funds, do let me know immediately to enable me to give\nyou detailed information on what to do. For me, I am looking forward\nto hearing from you soon.\nThanks with all my best regards.\nMr. Abderazack Zebdani"
