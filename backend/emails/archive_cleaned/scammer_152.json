I will advise that we should go for a Bank to\r\n   Bank transfer which is easier, because it will be deposited in your\r\n   provided account in less than 48 hours.\r\n   -\r\n   Barrister Bayo Jacobs\r\n   Jacob Chambers & Solicitors, Nigeria.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Sincerely Yours,\r\n\r\n   Barr Bayo Jacobs\n- Attorney at Law."
