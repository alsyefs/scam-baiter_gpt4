It's really heartwarming to know that there are organizations out there looking out for people like me.\n\nI'm curious though, how did you guys decide on compensating with exactly one million USD? And why through an ATM Visa Card payment? Is it because it's more secure or convenient?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nP.S. Please note that I won't be able to provide any personal information online due to security reasons. I hope you understand.\n\nBest wishes,\nRoy"
