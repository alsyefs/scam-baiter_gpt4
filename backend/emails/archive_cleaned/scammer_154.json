However, I must admit that I am quite surprised by your message as I had no prior knowledge of any assets being in my name.\n\nBefore we proceed, could you please provide more details about these assets and how they came to be partly in my name? Also, could you clarify what you mean by \"the funds being ours\"? \n\nAs for my personal details, I would prefer to share them once I have a better understanding of the situation at hand.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nKevin"
