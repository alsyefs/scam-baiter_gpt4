But when we started asking her some sensitive questions concerning the fund, she could not give the correct answer.\nSo we have her arrested and she confessed about her involvement with the staff. The two of them are now in police detention. You are therefore to get back with your details to enable us start the processing of your fund release.\nI wish you plenty of luck.\nBest regards,\nBen Richards\nForeign Remittance Department,\nUnited Bank for Africa   "

I'm glad your team caught them in time.\n\nCould you please tell me more about the fund you mentioned? How did it come into existence and why is it associated with my name? Also, could you provide some details about the processing of the fund release?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nJack"
