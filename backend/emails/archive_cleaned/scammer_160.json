        "body": "Hello Gary Winston,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, your message is quite surprising! I'm not aware of any unpaid debts or contracts associated with NNPC in Africa, Lottery fund, loans and grants etc. Also, I'm not sick and don't have any relatives who would claim such a thing.\n\nI'm curious about how my email address ended up on your list of people yet to be paid. Could you please provide more details about this? \n\nAlso, could you clarify the nature of these funds? Are they related to some kind of inheritance or something else?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nLatoya"
