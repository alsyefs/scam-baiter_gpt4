        "body": "Hello there,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I'm quite excited about this opportunity! However, I have a few questions that I hope you can help me with.\n\nFirstly, could you please explain more about the Senate Committee on Foreign Debt Settlement? What is their role in this process?\n\nSecondly, could you provide more details about the payment documents that need to be signed? What exactly do these documents entail?\n\nLastly, regarding the attorney who might represent me, how would that process work? Would I be able to choose my own attorney or would one be appointed for me?\n\nI look forward to your response. Thank you!\n\nPlease note: For security reasons, I won't be able to share any personal information such as my address or mobile number at this time.\n\nBest wishes,\nRoy"
