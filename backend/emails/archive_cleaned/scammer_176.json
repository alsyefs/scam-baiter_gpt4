Your proposal sounds interesting, but I would need more details before I can make a decision. \n\nCould you please provide more information about the nature of the investment you're considering? Also, could you clarify what expenses we might face in transferring the boxes?\n\nAs for my ID, I'm afraid it's against my company policy to share such sensitive personal information via email. However, rest assured that I am a reputable individual with a long history of successful business dealings.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nFrancisco"
