        "body": "Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out and expressing your concern. I must say, this is quite a surprising message to receive. I'm not sure where Mr. Garcia Charles Gilbert got his information from, but I can assure you that I have not been in any auto car accident recently.\n\nI am curious though, how did Mr. Garcia Charles Gilbert come to be in contact with you? And why does he believe he has the right to claim my contract payment fund?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nNorman"
