        "body": "Hello there,\n\nWow, this is such exciting news! I can't believe I've been selected for such an amazing prize. A brand new BMW and a check of USD? That's incredible!\n\nI'm curious about the selection process though. How exactly does the email selection system work? And how many people were part of this lottery?\n\nAlso, could you tell me more about the British Gaming Board and the International Association of Gaming Regulators? I'd love to know more about these organizations.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nP.S. - Just a quick note, I'm not comfortable sharing my personal details over email. Is there another way we can proceed with this?\n\nBest wishes,\nDaisey"
