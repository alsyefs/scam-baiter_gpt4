I was not referred by anyone, I came across the information about the government grant program online.\n2. As far as I know, I was not selected randomly. I applied for the grant through the official website and received a confirmation email which I can forward to you as evidence.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon regarding the next steps in this process.\n\nBest wishes,\nAnnie"
