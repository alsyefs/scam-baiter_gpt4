        "body": "Hello Collins,\n\nThank you for your detailed message. I'm quite interested in opening an online bank account with ACCESS Bank. The services you offer sound very appealing to me.\n\nI have a few questions though, if you don't mind. Could you please explain more about the differences between the various account models? Specifically, what are the benefits of each type of account?\n\nAlso, could you clarify what exactly is meant by \"initial deposit\"? Is this a one-time fee or will there be additional charges in the future?\n\nLastly, I noticed that there are several options for sending the initial deposit - RIA, Steam wallet card, Amazon card or iTunes card. Could you please provide more information on how these methods work?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nDouglas"
