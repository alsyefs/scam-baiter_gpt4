        "body": "Hello Mr. John Adi,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, this is quite an unexpected surprise! I'm intrigued by the prospect of receiving an ATM card from the Central Bank of Nigeria.\n\nI do have a few questions though, if you don't mind. You mentioned that my name and contact details were forwarded to you - may I ask who provided these details? Also, could you please explain more about how this ATM card works? Is it similar to regular bank cards?\n\nFurthermore, you mentioned a processing fee for the ATM card. Could you provide more information on what this fee covers? \n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nKevin"
