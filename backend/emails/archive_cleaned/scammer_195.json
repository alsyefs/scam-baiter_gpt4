I did not authorize any changes to my account nor did I provide any letters for clearance.\n\nI would appreciate it if you could provide more details about this situation, especially regarding the funds and the individuals involved. It is very concerning to hear that there are people attempting to access my funds without my consent.\n\nThank you for bringing this matter to my attention. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nJames"
