I'm really looking forward to resolving this matter.\n\nJust out of curiosity, could you please explain a bit more about how the Cote Ivoire Department of Justice works in these cases? And what exactly will they do with the file once it's done?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nGregory"
