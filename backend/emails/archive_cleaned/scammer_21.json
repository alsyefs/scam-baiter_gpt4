        "body": "Hello Mr. Tim Wennes,\n\nThank you for your detailed message. It's quite exciting to hear about the online bank account created on my behalf by Santander Bank. I must say, it's a bit surprising as well.\n\nI'm curious about a few things though. Could you please explain why this account was created without my prior knowledge? Also, could you provide more information about the transfer code and how it works?\n\nRegarding the payment of $500, is there any other method available apart from Western Union or purchasing a card? \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nShaun"
