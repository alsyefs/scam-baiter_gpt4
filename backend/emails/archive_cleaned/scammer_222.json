I am surprised to hear that I have been listed as a victim of fraud in Nigeria, as I have never had any dealings with individuals or businesses from there. However, if there has been some mistake and I am indeed entitled to a payment of five million US dollars, I would be grateful for your assistance in this matter.\n\nHere are the details you requested:\n\nFull Name: Lewis D. Noogie\nCurrent House Address: 1234 Elm Street, Novosibirsk, Latvia\nDirect Telephone: +371 12345678\nOccupation: Hotel Consultant\nAge: 45\n\nI look forward to hearing from you about the next steps in this process.\n\nBest regards,\nLewis D.\n\nBest wishes,\nRobert"
