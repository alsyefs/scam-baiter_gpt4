However, I must inform you that I am not comfortable with the idea of sending iTunes or Steam Wallet cards as a form of payment. This is not a standard banking procedure and it raises concerns about the legitimacy of this transaction.\n\nI would prefer to proceed with traditional banking methods. If there are fees to be paid, I would like to transfer them directly from my bank account to yours.\n\nPlease provide me with your banking details so we can proceed in this manner.\n\nBest wishes,\nMary"
