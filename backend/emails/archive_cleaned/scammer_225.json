That's news to me too. \n\nI'm curious, how did Mr. Bocian provide proof of his claims? It seems like a serious matter that would require substantial evidence.\n\nAlso, could you please explain more about this contract sum? I wasn't aware that there was any money involved.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nP.S: Please remember that I can't share any personal information online for security reasons.\n\nBest wishes,\nCurtis"
