I must say, it's not every day that one receives an email about a large sum of money.\n\nI'm curious though, could you please explain more about this contract payment? How did it come to be held by the Federal Reserve Bank? And why is it being transferred to me?\n\nAlso, could you provide more details about the clearance fee? What exactly does it cover?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nWynell"
