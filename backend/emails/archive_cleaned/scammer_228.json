Could you please provide more details about these funds? How did they end up being diverted from their original destination?\n\nAlso, could you clarify what you mean by \"our Gazette\"? Is it a document or a publication where I can find more information about this matter?\n\nI'm looking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nNancy"
