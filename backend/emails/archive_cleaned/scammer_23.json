        "body": "Hello Mr. Robert Brown,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me and providing such detailed information about the situation. I must say, it's quite surprising to hear from the Federal Bureau of United States.\n\nI'm a bit confused about this payment you mentioned. Could you please clarify what this payment is for? And who is Mr. Arlin Schwartz? I don't recall having any dealings with him or Deutsche Kredit Bank.\n\nAlso, could you explain more about the ITPC Statutory Fee? What exactly does it cover?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nAlfred"
