        "body": "Hello Mr. William S. Demchak,\n\nThank you for your message and the information provided. It's quite interesting to hear about this fund donation union and the involvement of the United States Government, PNC Internet Online Banking System, Federal Bureau FBI, and Homeland Security Director, MG Timothy J. Weinberg.\n\nI'm curious to know more about how this process works. Could you please explain a bit more about how this Personal Banking Account will be set up? And what exactly does it mean that I'll be able to check and make wire transfers out to any of my bank accounts in my country by myself through internet online?\n\nAlso, could you clarify why my passport or ID card is needed for this process? I'm just trying to understand everything clearly.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nMary"
