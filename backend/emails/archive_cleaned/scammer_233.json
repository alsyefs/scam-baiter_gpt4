        "body": "Hello Mr. Micheal Cohen,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me about this unclaimed payment. I must say, it's quite a surprise! I'm not sure how I missed such an important detail.\n\nI do have a few questions though, if you don't mind. You mentioned a \"Special NEW YEAR BONUS\", could you please elaborate on what that entails? Also, could you clarify the exact amount I need to pay to receive my funds?\n\nRegarding the Google Play CARD or any other GIFT CARD, is there a specific reason why these are the preferred methods of payment? \n\nLastly, could you provide more information about the bank account that has been opened in my favor? It would be great if you could share more details about this process.\n\nLooking forward to your response!\n\nBest wishes,\nLenny"
