        "body": "Hello Ma'am,\r\n\r\n My first mail to you  was very clear, I will help you secure the release\r\nof your contract sum which has been delayed by the remittance bank. You\r\nhave been proposed many ways to retrieve your funds but till now you have\r\nnot seen anything, why not give me a chance to explain before you jump to\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nI want you to know that all central banks of member states are affiliated\r\nto African Development Bank (ADB) as banks in different member states align\r\nwith their central banks so our mandate goes a long way to source the root\r\nof your transactions, the amount involved and why your funds have not\r\nreached you till date.\r\n\r\nYou have to cooperate with us if not we cannot be able to help you. The\r\nfirst step is to send a questionnaire to you to test and know if you are\r\nreally the owner of the fund and to know your last communication with the\r\npaying bank. We can go a long way to call the money back wherever it is\r\nlocated in the world because we have the mandate of the African Union (AU)\r\nwhich is an affiliate of the United Nations (UN).\r\n\r\nThe earlier you believe what I am telling you and start cooperating the\r\nbetter and easier for both of us. I am in the introductory part of my\r\nassistance to you.\r\n\r\nYou will give 10% of the total amount to my boss and 5% to me  after the\r\ntransfer of the fund to you.\r\n\r\nYou have to accept these conditions before I will take the bold step to go\r\nand meet him.\r\n\r\nAll payments will be made by TT wire transfer, there is no other means\r\navailable to us in the banking rules.\r\n\r\nI will be expecting your urgent reply.\r\n\r\nAlain Coulibaly (Office of the CEO. IRTD. ADB).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Alain Coulibaly,\r\nThank you for your email and the information provided. I am interested in\r\nthis opportunity, however, I would like to understand more about the\r\nprocess and what exactly is required from my side.\r\n\r\nCould you please provide more details on how we can proceed with this?\r\nAlso, could you clarify what percentage of the funds are expected to be\r\ngiven to the CEO and yourself?\r\n\r\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\nBest wishes,\r\nTheresa"
