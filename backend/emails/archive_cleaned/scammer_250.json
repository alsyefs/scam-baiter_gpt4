It's fascinating how it all works, isn't it? \n\nI do have a few questions though, if you don't mind. Could you please explain more about the Delivery Service Authority DSA? And what exactly does the security keeping fee entail?\n\nAlso, could you provide more information on the mode of diplomatic delivery? How does that work and what makes it different from regular delivery?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nGeorge"
