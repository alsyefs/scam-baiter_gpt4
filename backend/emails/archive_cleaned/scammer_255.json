        "body": "Hello,\n\nThank you for your message. It's quite interesting to hear about this ATM card payment method. I've never heard of it before, but it sounds like a convenient way to receive funds.\n\nCould you please explain more about how this ATM card works? And why is the maximum withdrawal limit set at five thousand dollars per day?\n\nAlso, I'm curious about the role of the Director General PENDU in this process. What exactly does he do?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nMichael"
