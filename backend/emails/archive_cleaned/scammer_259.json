        "body": "Hello there,\n\nThank you for your detailed message. It's quite an interesting proposition, I must say. However, I have a few questions that I'd like to clarify before proceeding further.\n\nFirstly, could you please explain why the payment needs to be made through an iTunes card or Steam wallet card? Is there any specific reason for this?\n\nSecondly, could you provide more information about the Affidavit of Claim Ownership? What exactly does it entail and why is it necessary?\n\nLastly, could you elaborate on how the ATM VISA CARD works? How can it accumulate such a large amount of funds and how secure is it?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nChris"
