I'm curious, though, could you provide a bit more detail about these meetings and how they led to this outcome? \n\nAlso, I'd love to understand better how the quick teller money transfer works. Is it a new technology or something that's been around for a while? And what makes it the preferred method for this transaction?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nDerrick"
