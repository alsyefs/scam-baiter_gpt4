        "body": "Hello Kelly Brown,\n\nThank you for reaching out and providing such detailed information. I must say, this is quite a surprise! I wasn't aware of any fraudulent activities against me. It's good to know that there are committees like yours working hard to rectify these situations.\n\nI'm curious about how the committee was able to identify me as a victim of fraud? Also, could you please explain more about the process of verifying an email address name? \n\nYou mentioned that my ATM card has been issued based on an email address name. Could you clarify which email address was used for this?\n\nAlso, I'd like to understand more about how the funds were credited to this ATM card. Is it possible for you to provide some details on this?\n\nLastly, you've asked me to contact REV. FATHER DANIEL KOMI and provide him with my complete details. Before doing so, could you tell me more about who he is and his role in this process?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nChris"
