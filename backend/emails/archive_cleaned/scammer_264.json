I am glad to hear that my name has been included to receive the overdue contract benefit through an approved ATM card. \n\nHowever, before we proceed, I would like to clarify a few things. Could you please provide more details about the delivery fee? How much is it and how should it be paid? Also, could you please explain more about the insurance fee and access code fee that have been removed?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nJason"
