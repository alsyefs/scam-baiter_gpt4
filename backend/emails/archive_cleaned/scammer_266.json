See following case details:\nCase Number: 1109-3211-0093-33SN on infamous internet fraudsters, Gabriel Wilson, 34 and Boris Stevennick, 46, was tried and closed at the District Court of Hochdorf, Division III (Bezirksgericht des Kantons Hochdorf, Division III) as of last year after numerous rejected extradition appeals. They were apprehended at Euro-Airport, Basel while fleeing Switzerland federal authorities in an unrelated fraud case. The prior case was closed based upon the following settlement terms;\nI. Court-ordered restitution - select offshore bank accounts recovered from the defendants shall be converted into settlement funds to be remitted to eligible affected victims,\nII. To be paid in full before the end of sentence date.\nIf you are receiving a notification but do not recollect a scam incident, you were a victim of identity theft which generally occurs without your consent. Records suggest that you have been a victim because your contact details and personal information were found on several computer devices belonging to the defendants, alongside corresponding expense, service and property receipts acquired using your credentials. Following court orders, this makes you eligible for\n \nA. Compensation and reimbursements of false acquisitions,\nB. Compensation for potential impact on your credit, and any additional verifiable claims you may make will be considered.\nDuring investigation, authorities revealed that the pair operated on an international scale victimizing thousands of individuals and companies from several countries with the bulk of victims residing in Australia and the United Kingdom. They hid a majority of their acquisitions in offshore Swiss bank accounts and properties. Based on that revelation, the Switzerland government ordered court proceedings be held within Switzerland where the defendants were apprehended to maintain unitary judgment and integrity in international relations. Due to the diverse locations of the victims, local victims were represented by a local barrister and international victims by court appointed international solicitor/counsel-at-law.\nPlease note : This is just a summary, full case details and settlement amount you are entitled to will be provided upon your request.
