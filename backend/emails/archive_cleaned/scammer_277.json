However, I am a bit confused about the details of this transaction.\n\nCould you please provide me with the exact MTCN (Money Transfer Control Number) and the sender's full name? This information is crucial for me to pick up the money from my local Western Union outlet.\n\nAlso, could you clarify what you mean by \"activation of your document file\"? What documents are these exactly? And why do I need to purchase an Apple gift card?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nMatthew"
