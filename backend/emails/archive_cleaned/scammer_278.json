I appreciate your efforts in ensuring the safety of my funds.\n\nI understand the urgency of this matter, and I'm glad to know that you're taking steps to prevent any unauthorized access to my funds. It's quite alarming to hear about Ms. Sophie MM Winchester's attempt, but I trust that you're handling it appropriately.\n\nHowever, before we proceed further, could you please clarify a few things for me? \n\n1) How did Ms. Sophie MM Winchester get access to my fund details?\n2) What measures are being taken to ensure such incidents don't occur in the future?\n3) Could you provide more details about the court stop order process?\n\nI'm sorry for all these questions, but as you can understand, this is a significant matter for me.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nScott"
