        "body": "From Mrs. Debbie Sutter\nGod bless you as you assist me.\nDear\nI am the above-named person from Switzerland. But now undergoing\nmedical treatment in India. I am married to Dr. Davis Wakis Sutter who\nworked With  Switzerland Embassy in the UK for Nine years before he\ndied on February 12th, 2022. We were married for eleven years without\na child.\nHe died after a brief illness that lasted for only four Days. Before\nhis death we were both born again Christians. Since his death I\ndecided not to re-marry or get a Child outside my matrimonial home,\nwhich the Bible is against. When my late husband was alive he\ndeposited the sum of $6.5Million (Six Million Five hundred thousand\nU.S.Dollars) with HSBC BANK UK Presently in the United Kingdom. Just\nlast week, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next one\nmonths due to cancer. Having known my condition I decided to donate\nthis Fund to you as a better Christian individual that will utilize\nthis money the way I am going to Instruct here in.\nI want a church or individual that will use this fund for a\nNon-Governmental Foundation, orphanages, Old people homes and to\npropagate the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is\nmaintained.\nThe Bible made us understand that blessed is the hand that Giveth. I\ntook this decision because I don't have any child That will inherit\nthis money and my husband's relatives Are not Christians and I don't\nwant my husband's hard Earned money to be misused by unbelievers,\nHence the reason for taking this bold Decision. I am not afraid of\ndeath hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in\nthe bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight\nmy case and I shall hold my peace. I don't need any telephone\nCommunication in this regard because of my health, and Because of the\npresence of my husband's relatives around me always.\nI do not want them to know about this Development. As soon As I\nreceive your reply I shall give you the contact Of my lawyer who will\nhelp you effect the changes to your name as the original-beneficiary\nof this fund.\nI want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my\nshepherd. My happiness is that I lived the life of a worthy Christian.\nWhoever that wants to serve the Lord Must serve him in spirit and\ntruth.\nPlease always be Prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your\nreply will give me room in Sourcing for a  church or christian\norganization for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act\naccordingly as I stated herein. Hoping to hear from you.\nThanks and God bless you.\nMrs. Debbie Sutter"

It's truly admirable that you're thinking of others and wanting to do good in the world despite what you're going through.\n\nYour faith is inspiring, and it's clear that you have a strong relationship with God. Your reference to Exodus VS is a powerful reminder of His love and protection.\n\nI'm curious about how you came across my contact information? Also, could you tell me more about the work your husband did at the embassy? It sounds like he was a dedicated individual.\n\nThank you for considering me for this responsibility. I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nGeorge"
