        "body": "Hello Mr. Chris Innocent,\n\nI appreciate your email and the opportunity you're presenting to me. It's quite intriguing, I must say. However, I have a few questions that I hope you wouldn't mind answering.\n\nFirstly, could you please explain more about this accrued interest? How did it come about and why is it being offered to me specifically?\n\nSecondly, you mentioned an ATM card loaded with the interest amount. Could you provide more details on how this works? Is it like a regular debit card that I can use at any ATM?\n\nLastly, regarding the courier fee for EMS Speed Post, could you give me an estimate of how much this might cost? \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nLeona"
