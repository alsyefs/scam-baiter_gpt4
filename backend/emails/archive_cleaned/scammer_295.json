I knew\nit will be very grueling for you to accept fully with what it takes to\nstart and complete this transaction with me due to your past\nexperience.\nIndeed this is a transaction that involved high enormity of fund and\nas a result, it will require a lot of process to see this transaction\nout-and-out. I seek for your permission for partnership, therefore i\nwill appreciate it so much and it will help us if you will partner\nwith me with full confident.\nIn a partnership of this class, both of us are expected to contribute\nfinancially and time but one end must be high in expense based on the\nratio as i stated in my proposal.
