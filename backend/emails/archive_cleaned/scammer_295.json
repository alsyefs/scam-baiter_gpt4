I seek for your permission for partnership, therefore i\nwill appreciate it so much and it will help us if you will partner\nwith me with full confident.\nIn a partnership of this class, both of us are expected to contribute\nfinancially and time but one end must be high in expense based on the\nratio as i stated in my proposal.
