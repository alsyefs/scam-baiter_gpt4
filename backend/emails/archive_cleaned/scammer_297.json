I appreciate your efforts in resolving the issues surrounding it.\n\nI understand that I need to get a United Nations Approval code NO to access my online bank account. Could you please guide me on how I can contact Attorney John Blessing? You mentioned an email and a telephone number, but I don't see them in your message.\n\nAlso, could you please provide more details about this United Nations Approval code NO? What is its purpose and why is it necessary for accessing my online bank account?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nJames"
