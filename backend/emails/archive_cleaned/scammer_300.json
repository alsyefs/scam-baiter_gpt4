        "body": "Hello Ms. Kristalina Georgieva,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, this is quite a surprise! I don't recall having any unpaid funds worth of US Ten Million United States Dollars. \n\nI'm not sure who Kevin from Canada is, and I certainly didn't instruct anyone to claim or receive any payment on my behalf. As for Williams Rogers, I'm afraid I don't know who that is either.\n\nRegarding the Deed of Assignment, I haven't signed anything like that recently. Could you please provide more information about this? \n\nAlso, could you tell me more about how the IMF recovered these funds? It's fascinating how global monetary security works!\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nThomas"
