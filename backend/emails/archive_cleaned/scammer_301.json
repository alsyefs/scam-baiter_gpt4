        "body": "Hello Oniha,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I appreciate the update regarding the payment delay from The Debt Management Office DMO Nigeria and the Central Bank. It's good to know that my payment is being taken care of.\n\nCould you please provide more details about this Contract Payment Decree? I'm not quite familiar with it, so any additional information would be helpful.\n\nAlso, could you clarify what you mean by \"your payment has been the next your money will be confirmed with your bank\"? I'm a bit confused about this part.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nStephanie"
