I must say, it's quite an unusual situation you've found yourself in.\n\nI'm curious to know more about how this process works. How exactly would I be able to stand in as the next of kin for Mr. Albert Sen Daly?

What kind of documents will they be obtaining from the Federal Ministry High Court of Justice?\n\nI look forward to hearing more details about this proposal.\n\nBest wishes,\nKathleen"
