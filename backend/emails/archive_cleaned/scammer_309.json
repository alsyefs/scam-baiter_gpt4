I paid it because the ATM Card, worth US$9,000,000, has less than 12 weeks to expire and when it expires, the money will go into the Government purse.\nWith that I decided to help you pay the money so that the ATM will not expire Now \nI want you to contact DHL DELIVERY SERVICE with your Full Contact information so that they can deliver your ATM Card to your designated address also make sure that you send your full name and your phone number Like I stated earlier the delivery charges has been paid but the only fee you have to pay now is the official keeping fee which will cost you only $98 only.\nThey refused and the reason is that they do not know when you are going to contact them and demur-rage might have increased. They told me that their keeping fee is $98 and that is the only delay.\nSo we want you to go to any Supermarket or Apple Store around you to purchase Steam Wallet card or Apple gift card or NORDSTROM CARD, then scratch it secrete and make sure that no one see it to avoid redeem to another person then use your phone to snap it then you send me the copes okay.\nBelow is their Contact Information,\nContact Person: Mr. David M. Uso,\nDHL DELIVERY FAST SERVICE\nEmail: (   \ndhldeliveryf@gmail.com\n  )\nContact them today to avoid an increase of their keeping fees and let me know Once you receive your Card.\nYours Faithfully,\nMr.James Dimon ,\nClaim Your Atm Card Today"
