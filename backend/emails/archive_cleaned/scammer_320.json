        "body": "Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, this is quite a surprise! I had no idea about this fund. It's also surprising to hear about William Huges and John Camel claiming to be my relatives. I don't recall having any relatives by those names.\n\nI'm curious, how did these two gentlemen prove their relationship to me? And could you please provide more details about the fund? How did it come into existence and why was it assigned to me?\n\nAlso, I'm not familiar with steam wallet or gift cards as a method of payment. Could you explain how that works?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nGeorge"
