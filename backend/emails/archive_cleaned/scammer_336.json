I can assure you that I am very much alive and well, despite what Mr. Gubochkin Andrei might have claimed.\n\nI'm curious about how this mix-up happened in the first place.

Also, could you tell me more about this fund money that is supposedly mine?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nMary"
