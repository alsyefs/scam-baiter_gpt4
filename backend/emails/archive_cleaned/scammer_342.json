EVANS DOUGLAS , I have the mandate and full authority from a super ceding authority to verify your transaction and subsequently release/transferyour overdue funds into your nominated bank account if no irregularity is uncovered during the process of verification.\n \nAs you may rightly want to know, this development was necessitated as a result of massive outcry/complaint from bona fide foreign beneficiaries globally on the issue of delay, hindrances and repeated problems on foreign payments which also includes attachment of difficult and unfavorable conditions from agencies, authorities and financial institutions within ECO WAS region which in no small measures contributed as an obstacle to foreign beneficiaries in receiving their funds.\n \nIn order to proffer a lasting and sustainable solution to these problems the ECONOMIC COMMUNITIES OF WEST AFRICA STATES (ECO WAS) had to wedge into the matter by setting up a panel to review and submit report on this sensitive issues in order to remedy the situation and also to redeem the lost image of ECO WAS region.\n \nIn line with the report of the panel, all charges, fees and unnecessary payments which beneficiaries were liable to for one reason or the other have been cancelled and a total sum of US$7, 800,000  (Seven million, eight hundred US Dollars) have been earmarked as initial payment for every affected beneficiary. Therefore, the only thing you need to do as a foreign beneficiary of the said funds from any ECO WAS country is to procure a TAX IDENTIFICATION NUMBER(TIN) in accordance with the new directives.\n \nFurther, note that Ghana has been appointed as the only authorized payment centre because of its position as a sanitized and peaceful nation, this means that all payments originally sourced and accrued from all countries within the ECO WAS country have been channeled to Ghana for onward transfer to qualified foreign beneficiaries.\n \n \nWe have been instructed to conclude the entire exercise on or before the last second quarter of year 2022. Any beneficiary who fails to meet up within the stipulated period would have his/her funds paid into the ECO WAS treasury as unclaimed funds.\n \n \nFinally, to help us commence with the process of transfer in accordance with the new directives you will be required to send us useful details as stated below for reconfirmation in order to avoid wrong payment/transfer.\n \n1. FULL NAMES AND ADDRESS:\n2.  TELEPHONE NUMBER:\n3. TOTAL AMOUNT DUE:\n4. SOURCE OF PAYMENT:\n5. OCCUPATION:\n6. DATE OF BIRTH\n7. BANK DETAILS:\n \nI await your prompt response.\nYours faithfully,\nMr. Evans Douglas.   "

        "body": "Hello Mr. Evans Douglas,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with this information. It's quite interesting to hear about the efforts of the ECONOMIC COMMUNITY OF WEST AFRICA STATES (ECOWAS) in resolving issues related to foreign payments. I must say, it's a commendable initiative.\n\nI'm curious about the TAX NUMBER TIN you mentioned. Could you please explain more about it? How does one procure it and what is its significance in this process?\n\nAlso, could you provide more details on how the payment transfer will be carried out once all necessary information is provided? I'd like to understand the process better.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nOllie"
