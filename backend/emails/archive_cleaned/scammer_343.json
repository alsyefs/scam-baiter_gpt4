It sounds quite official and important.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit confused about some parts of it. Could you please clarify what FIRS Tax clearance Money is? And what does BCEAO Authority mean? \n\nAlso, could you explain why there's a need for me to make a payment? What exactly is this payment for?\n\nLooking forward to your response. Thanks!\n\nBest wishes,\nMike"
