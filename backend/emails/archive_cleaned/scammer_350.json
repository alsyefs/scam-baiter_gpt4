It's really great to hear that organizations like the Monetary Fund IMF and World Bank are working together to help people like me.\n\nI'm curious though, how did my email end up on this list? And could you tell me more about this process? How does it work exactly?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nFranklin"
