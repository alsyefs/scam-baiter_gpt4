Sir/ Madam\nSir,\nI AM MR PETER DA SILVER, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER IN CHARGE OF FINANCE AND\nACCOUNTS IN THE NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION (NNPC).\nDue to many complaints of various fees paid by the beneficiaries of these\ncontract/inheritance claims without receiving their due payments for the\npast twenty years when the Military and former civilian government were in\npower in Nigeria, the new civilian government gave directive to all\ngovernment AGENCIES, MINISTRIES AND PARASTATALS to adopt the policy of\ndeducting BANK AND TRANSFER fees associated with the various claims and\ntransfer the balance to their respective\nbeneficiaries.\nThe directive specified that:\n(1) Each of the beneficiaries should write an authorization letter to the\ngovernment agency from where his or her claim originated that all bank and\ntransfer charges SHOULD BE DEDUCTED FROM THEIR FUNDS AND BALANCE REMITTED\nTO THEIR STIPULATED BANK ACCOUNTS.\n(2) The authorization letter to deduct fees should be ENDORSED by a\ncompetent court here to make it legal and valid in law. YOU WILL PAY AN\nENDORSEMENT FEE TO THE COURT. This fee cannot be deducted from your\nprincipal sum because your deduction authorization letter remains\nineffective and not binding until ENDORSED BY THE COURT.\n(3)All concerned/relevant government agencies should recognize such\nauthorization letters as soon as ENDORSED AND ABIDE BY IT.\n(4) Any claim that have stayed for over (7) SEVEN YEARS UNPAID AND AFTER\nVERIFICATION, THE BENEFICIARY SHOULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO PRESENT ANY\nCONTRACT DOCUMENTATION WHERE THE DOCUMENTS ARE NO LONGER AVAILABLE BEFORE\nHIS OR HER PAYMENT IS PROCESSED AND TRANSFER EFFECTED.\n(5) All concerned/relevant government agencies should ensure that all fund\nclearance approvals are issued to the beneficiaries to avoid confiscation,\nstoppage or placing embargo on funds when transferred.\n(6) All accrued interest should be worked out and paid upon the completion\nof payment of principal amounts.\nTHIS NEW MEASURE BY GOVERNMENT IS TO ENSURE THAT NOBODY DEMANDS ENDLESS\nFEES IN THE FORM OF CHARGES AND DOCUMENTATION FROM THE BENEFICIARIES OF\nTHESE OUTSTANDING CLAIMS AS PRACTICED IN THE PAST TWENTY YEARS.\nBe informed that the Federal Executive Council has approved your\ncontract/inheritance claim payment.\nIn view of the above, you are required to provide/reconfirm the following\ninformation for the process and transfer of your funds.\n(A) YOUR FULL NAMES:\n(B)YOUR BANK COORDINATES:\n(C) YOUR ADDRESS:\n(D) YOUR CONTACT TELEPHONE NUMBER:\n(E) YOUR VALID IDENTIFICATION\n(F) YOUR CLAIM AMOUNT.\nIF THERE IS NO RESPONSE TO THIS MESSAGE, WE WILL HAVE NO OTHER OPTION THAN\nTO BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE EITHER DEAD OR HAS GIVEN UP THE FUNDS AND IT WILL\nBE CANCELLED AND THE FILE CLOSED AS TREATED.\nThank you.\nYours Truly,\nMr.Peter Da Silver\nChief Operating Officer,Finance & Accounts\nNigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC   "

        "body": "Hello Mr. Peter Da Silver,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with this information. It's quite a lot to take in, and I must admit, it sounds like a very serious matter.\n\nI'm curious about the process you've described. Could you please explain more about how these fees are calculated? And what exactly is the role of the court in endorsing the deduction letter?\n\nAlso, could you provide more details about the Federal Executive Council's approval of my contract claim payment? I don't recall having any contracts that would require such approval.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nDaniel"
