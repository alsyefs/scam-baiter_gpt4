I am Dr (Mrs) Olivia Onuoha,the office assistant to the Central Bank Governor (Mr.Godwin Emefiele).I am not telling you this to impress you or to gain any favor from you, rather I am doing this to save you from further damage and pains.I have done this to two people already, though they betrayed me at the end.\nBefore I proceed,you must promise me that nobody will know of this and after you are satisfied with my job,you can help me in whatever way the spirit of God directs you.\n \nThis is very secret,I overheard Mr.Godwin Emefiele and other bank executives here in Nigeria saying that they will make sure you spend and pay much fees till you are tired and abandoned your UN/ World Bank Approved compensation amount of $10,000,000.00 (Ten million United States Dollars) for them to later divert to an already opened offshore account in USA. Please do not pay anything to anyone again regarding the release of your fund(ATM CARD) because none of these evil perpetrators have your interest at heart. The President of Nigeria and the members of his Federal Executive Council have since endorsed the payment of this approved compensation fund to you and your account is already activated which you can access at any time and your ATM card programmed and ready to be dispatched to you. It is just that some of our bank executives are very greedy and they have created avenues to steal your money even when they know that the situation is very critical. I and another Christian colleague in the office have to help you out.\n \nNow, we have perfectly pulled out the ATM card that contains your UN/ World Bank Compensation payment amount . We are ready to send it to you immediately, PLEASE, our job is on the line. I am only 34 years married with two kids (A Boy and A Girl) and I don't want to ruin my future or die at this early age. I do not make calls on transactions like this due to the sensitive nature of this transaction and my position with the CBN. I will not deliver this ATM card to you if you let anyone know of this.\n \nIf this arrangement is OK with you please reply now and we will send the ATM card to you through DHL and all these horrendous and callous treatment will stop and you will happily receive your fund to your designated home address.\n \nI shall attach my personal identifications to you as soon as I hear from you positively.\n \nGet back to me if you are interested so that we can proceed.\n \nRegards.\n \nDr (Mrs) Olivia Onuoha.\nOffice assistant to the Central Bank Governor.

        "body": "Hello Dr Mrs Olivia Onuoha,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with this information. I must say, it's quite a surprise! I appreciate your Christian faith and your concern for my well-being.\n\nI'm curious about the situation you've described. It sounds very serious and complicated. Could you please explain more about how these bank executives are planning to divert funds? And how did you manage to pull out the ATM card that contains the UN World Bank payment amount?\n\nAlso, I'm interested in knowing more about the process of sending the ATM card through DHL. How does that work exactly? \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nRachael"
