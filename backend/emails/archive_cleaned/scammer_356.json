        "body": "Hello Clark,\n\nWow, this is such exciting news! I can't believe my luck. It's not every day that one gets to hear about receiving such a large sum of money. \n\nI'm curious though, how did my name end up on the list of recipients? And what exactly is an Original Funds Classified Document (OFCD)? I've never heard of it before.\n\nAlso, you mentioned that I would need to travel to two different countries. Could you please tell me which countries these are? I'd like to know so I can start planning my trip accordingly.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nTisha"
