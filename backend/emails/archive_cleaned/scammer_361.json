It's quite unfortunate that there was a mix-up with the recipient address.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit confused about how this could have happened as I usually double-check all my details before sending them out. Could you please provide more information on what exactly was incorrect or incomplete? This would help me avoid such mistakes in the future.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nKimberly"
