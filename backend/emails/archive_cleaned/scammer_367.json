        "body": "Hello Mr. Daniel Udoh,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. Your email certainly piqued my interest, and I must say it's quite intriguing! It's not every day that one hears about such a large sum of money.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit confused about some details in your message. Could you please clarify what DMT stands for? Also, why is the fund more than what has been approved to be paid to me?\n\nAs for protecting your identity, rest assured that I understand the importance of confidentiality and will do my best to respect it.\n\nRegarding the information you asked for, I'm afraid I can't provide them at this moment due to personal reasons. But don't worry, we can still continue our conversation and discuss further details about this matter.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nCindy"
