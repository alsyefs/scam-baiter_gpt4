I'm just an ordinary person, you know? \n\nI'm curious though, how did my name come up in all of this? And why would bank officials try to divert my funds into their private accounts? That doesn't sound very nice at all.\n\nAlso, could you tell me more about this ATM card? How does it work exactly? Is it safe and secure?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nP.S. I'd love to share my details with Mr. Hans Bruce but I've been told not to give out personal information online. Is there another way we can verify my identity?\n\nBest wishes,\nJoan"
