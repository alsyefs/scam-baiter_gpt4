        "body": "Hello Hon. Edward Hicks,\n\nThank you for your email and the information provided. It's quite interesting to know about the mandate of the United Nations and their efforts towards clearing funds not associated with drugs and terrorist activities.\n\nI'm curious about this process though, could you please provide more details? For instance, how was I shortlisted for this payment? And what exactly does signing the fund release order documents bond entail?\n\nAlso, it's very generous of the investor sponsor to cover all expenses including return flight tickets, hotel feeding, and taxi. However, I would like to understand more about his demand for a percentage of my total payment. Could you elaborate on that?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nAngela"
