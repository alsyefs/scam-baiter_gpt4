        "body": "Hello Jones,\n\nThank you for your detailed message. It's quite exciting to hear about the ATM VISA CARD and its potential benefits. I appreciate your efforts in ensuring that it gets delivered safely.\n\nI'm curious, though. How does this process work exactly? And why is there a need for me to send a gift card or an Amazon gift card? Could you please explain more about this?\n\nAlso, I noticed that you mentioned a secret code digit number. Is this something I should be aware of beforehand or will it be provided with the ATM CARD?\n\nI'm looking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nNaomi"
