        "body": "  Hello \n Thanks for your response, my late client's name was Alan Murthy, in which his family name is similar to yours, he was a business magnate, who lived in Spain for over a decade prior to his death. He died along with his family during the Sichuan Catastrophe, which occurred on the 12th day of May 2008 during their short holiday visits to Shanghai China.\nPrior to further explanation, please accept my apology for this unsolicited mail. I am conscious that this is certainly not a predictable way of approach to fostering a relationship of trust, but because of the circumstances and urgency surrounding this claim, before the catastrophe; He deposited One Trunk Box/Diplomatic Personal Treasure, containing the sum of $16.2 (SIXTEEN MILLION,TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLARS) with a Safe Security Company here in Spain, because of security and personal reasons he did not disclose the exact content of the vault/deposited diplomatic box to the SAFE KEEPING HOUSE.\nAs the attorney to late Mr.Alan, the security company has mandated me to present a member of his family (heir/inheritor) to make Claims, or the vault will be confiscated and taken to the Bureau of Diplomatic Security Box as unclaimed property, After exhaustive efforts and searching for a direct family member to my late client which came to no avail, I was given the last option early this year to present a next of kin for the claim or have the fund liquidated and made unserviceable in accordance with existing laws.\nThe reason I reach out to you is as a last resort of mounting pressure on me from the safekeeping company to present the beneficiary to the vault of my late client above all because I know it is legally very possible. I know you might not be in any way related to my late client, but the reason I contacted you is that after the death of my late client and his family, I was informed by the Safe Keeping Company to search for any member of his extended family (related especially with a common surname); to put up a claim for his deposited Vault with them.\nAfter a rigorous search for a direct family member which came to no avail and the reminder notice I got from the safekeeping firm at the beginning of this year to look for some relative to come for the claim or the vault will be reported as unclaimed.\nMy suggestion for you and I to collaborate to claim this estate, mind you that there is no atom of risk connected to this business as I have worked out all modalities to complete the operation effectively and we keep this process confidential till we get all the legal approval from the Spanish government. Once the consignment (vault) is released to you, we shall divide the content in the ratio of 50% for each, as our benefit and this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.\nPlease mind that we don't need to make undue publicity as this can hamper the process of taking into cognizance that we are not quite sure if you're really related. Discretion must be maintained.\nI think it is better for us to have a direct conversation via phone to intimate you more about this process before we start, thus do not forget to include your direct phone number in your next response as I intend to call you later. I await your reply to my email.\n Best Regards,\nAntonio Garcia Baez   "

        "body": "Hello Antonio Garcia Baez,\n\nWow, that's quite a story! I'm sorry to hear about the tragic fate of Mr. Alan Murthy and his family. It's always sad when such things happen.\n\nI must admit, this is all very new and surprising to me. I've never been involved in anything like this before. Could you please explain more about how this process works? How did you find me and decide that I could be a potential relative of Mr. Murthy?\n\nAlso, you mentioned some legal approvals from the Spanish authorities. What kind of approvals are these? And how long does it usually take to get them?\n\nI'm looking forward to hearing more about this.\n\nBest wishes,\nKim"
