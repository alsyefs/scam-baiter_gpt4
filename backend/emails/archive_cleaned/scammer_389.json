I've never been involved in anything like this before. \n\nCould you please explain a bit more about the deceased's estate? How did my name come up in all of this? And what exactly are my duties over the estate?\n\nAlso, could you provide me with more information about the process at Natwest Bank? What will happen after they approve the fund release?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nHolly"
