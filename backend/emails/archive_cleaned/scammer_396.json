        "body": "Hello Mr. David Bengt,\n\nThank you for your detailed explanation about the funding structure terms. It's quite interesting to learn about the different platforms and processes involved in debt financing and loan finance.\n\nI'm curious, how does your investment team determine if a project is viable and lucrative? What are some of the key factors they look at?\n\nAlso, could you please elaborate more on the KYC process? I understand it's important for due diligence but I'd like to know more about what it entails.\n\nLastly, you mentioned that there are fixed monthly payments with no early repayment penalty. Could you provide an example of how this would work?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nKevin"
