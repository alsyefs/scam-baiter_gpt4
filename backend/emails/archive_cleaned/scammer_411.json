It's very kind of you to think about charity work in such difficult times.\n\nYou mentioned a significant amount of money that your late husband deposited in a bank. That's quite a fortune! Could you please share more details about the charity work you have in mind? Are there any specific orphanages or causes that are close to your heart?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nRupert"
