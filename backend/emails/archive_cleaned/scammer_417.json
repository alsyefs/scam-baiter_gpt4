I was not aware of any such funds and this is the first time I am hearing about it.\n\nBefore proceeding further, could you please provide more details about these funds? Specifically, I would like to know:\n\n1. How did these funds come under my name?\n2. What is the exact amount of the funds?\n3. Why do I need to pay for an anti-terrorist clearance?\n\nI would appreciate if you could provide clear answers to these questions before we proceed further.\n\nBest wishes,\nDeanna"
