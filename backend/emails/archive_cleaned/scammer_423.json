I must say, it's a bit overwhelming too.\n\nI'm curious about the transfer code you mentioned. Could you explain more about what it is and how it works? Also, why is there a fee associated with issuing this code?\n\nAnd regarding the payment methods, could you please clarify why these specific methods are preferred? \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nKathleen"
