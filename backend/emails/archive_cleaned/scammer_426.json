        "body": "Hello Mr. John Campbell,\n\nThank you for your detailed message. I must say, it's quite a lot to take in! I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed, so I might need some help understanding everything.\n\nYou mentioned something about a payment processing fee. Could you explain what that is exactly? And why do I need to pay it?\n\nAlso, you mentioned some documents that will be sent to me once the fee is paid. What kind of documents are these? Are they important?\n\nI'm sorry for all the questions, but as I said, I'm not very good with these things and just want to make sure I understand everything correctly.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you!\n\nP.S: Sorry, but I can't provide my banking details or any personal information online. It's just a safety thing, you know?\n\nBest wishes,\nLori"
