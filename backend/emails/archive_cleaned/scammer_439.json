I'm quite surprised to receive your email, but it's a pleasant surprise nonetheless. \n\nI must say, the information you've shared is intriguing. However, I have a few questions that I'd like to clarify before proceeding further.\n\nFirstly, could you please provide more details about the mandate for transferring my payment via Western Union? Who exactly has given this mandate?\n\nSecondly, you mentioned that you tried calling me yesterday and this morning. Unfortunately, I didn't receive any calls. Could there be an issue with the phone number you have on file?\n\nLastly, regarding the MTCN and sender name - could you please explain what these are and how they work? \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nMinnie"
