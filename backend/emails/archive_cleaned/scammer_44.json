Could you please provide more details about this? \n\nAlso, could you clarify what you mean by \"incessant complaints filtering this office from affected\"? I'm not sure I understand that part.\n\nI appreciate your assistance and look forward to hearing back from you.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nPatricia"
