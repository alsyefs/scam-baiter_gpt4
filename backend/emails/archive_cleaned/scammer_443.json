I must say, it's not every day that one receives such an unexpected message.\n\nCould you please provide me with more details about this? How did Mr. Antonio Guterres come to choose me for this? And why is the United Nations involved in transferring funds via Western Union?\n\nI'm also curious about the process of releasing these funds. Could you explain it a bit more? \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nClifford"
