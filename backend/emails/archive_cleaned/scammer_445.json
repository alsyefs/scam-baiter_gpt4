        "body": "Hello Ms. Jane Marriott OBE,\n\nThank you for your detailed message. It's quite alarming to hear about all these scams happening around the world. I appreciate your efforts in trying to combat this issue.\n\nI'm curious, how does the US Financial Crimes Network work with other countries to ensure that victims are protected? Also, could you explain more about the United Nations funds list? How can one check if their name is on it?\n\nI'm also interested in understanding more about how these impostors operate. How do they manage to pose as reputable organizations like the FBI and CIA?\n\nLastly, you mentioned a designated department in charge of fund files. Could you provide more information about this department and its role?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest wishes,\nEdgar"
