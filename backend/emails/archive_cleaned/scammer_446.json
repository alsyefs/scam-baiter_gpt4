        "body": "Hello Anita William,\n\nThank you for reaching out and providing this detailed information. I appreciate your efforts to help me with my payment. However, I have a few questions that I would like to clarify before proceeding further.\n\nFirstly, could you please explain why there is a fee required for accessing my funds? Also, could you provide more details about the Special BONUS you mentioned?\n\nSecondly, I'm not quite familiar with the process of paying via Card, Google Play CARD or Stream Wallet. Could you guide me through it?\n\nLastly, once the payment is made, how long will it take for me to access my funds online and transfer them to my designated bank account?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nRobert"
