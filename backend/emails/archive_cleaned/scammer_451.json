        "body": "Hello Dr. Joshua Ankwa,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me and I hope this message finds you well. I must say, your email was quite a surprise! It's not every day that one hears about their own supposed demise.\n\nI can assure you that I am very much alive and well. The information about my alleged car accident is completely false. As for Mr. Shestov Aleksandr Ivanovich and Dr. Raymond Essien, I have no knowledge of these individuals nor any connection with them.\n\nI'm curious though, how did my name end up on the list of contract claims? Could you provide more details about this contract? Also, could you explain what the process would be like if we were to proceed with this?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nWalter"
