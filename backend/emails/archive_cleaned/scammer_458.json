        "body": "Hello Mr. Terry Tuggle,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me from the FIRST NATIONAL BANK TEXAS. It's quite surprising to hear about this agreement reached by President Joe Biden and other world Presidents. I must say, it's a significant step towards resolving delayed or denied payments.\n\nThe amount mentioned, Ten Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars, is indeed a substantial sum. However, I'm curious as to why my funds were unpaid in the first place? Could you provide more details on that?\n\nAlso, could you please elaborate on the role of the committee set up by the US government? How do they monitor these payments?\n\nI appreciate your assistance and look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nKayla"
