        "body": "Hello Alan Buxton,\n\nThank you for your message. It's quite exciting to hear about this opportunity! I'm a bit surprised though, as I wasn't expecting any payment. Could you please tell me more about how my name ended up on the World Bank foreign debts settlement payment file? \n\nAlso, could you provide more details about the different options for receiving the funds? What would be the process for each option and are there any fees associated with them?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nVickie"
