This is official notice to you that this office of His Excellency Mr. President Patrice Talon has been mandated to monitor and follow up your payment of Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars $8.5 Million through Benin Republic. Moreover,\nI have sent you a email before traveling out from the office to Saudi Arabia for a business transaction. Furthermore, I have not been happy because my heart has not been at peace because your fund has been troubling me, since I came back just some few weeks ago and when I asked about your payment case, I was informed that your compensation payment has not yet been completed and paid, Perhaps, you know your fund has been wired into an ATM VISA CARD but due to the delay in the process of delivering your ATM VISA CARD, the process was cancelled and now your fund has been withdrawn and ready to be wired to you in cash. But orders came from His Excellency President Patrice Talon.\nNow the only fee required by the CENTRAL BANK is just the CENTRAL BANK ACTIVATION APPROVAL OF THE CHEQUE which is $55 no COD. This payment is the only money you will have to pay to they to receive this cheque in your home address, and as soon as you send this $55,you are going to receive your funds through a LETTERED BANK DRAFT CHEQUE\n and the reason why this $55.00 is needed for the ACTIVATION of the cheque is to enable you to have no problems in cashing out the cheque, because as soon as this cheque is activated,\nAnd when you receive it you can take it to any bank of your choice and pick up the cash without any trouble or any further delay; Furthermore,Mr President Patrice Talon has approved your FUND TRANSFER CHEQUE of $8.5Million usd. No any other person or individual will call for the claiming of this fund except you because you are the sole beneficiary and ownership of this fund, because we won’t allow any\nother person to claim this fund and the reason why I am saying all this us because there are many imposters these days that are claiming\npeople’s funds. So kindly get back to us with the below information because your CHEQUE will be sent to you as a LETTER, this means that\nyou will receive your cheque through a LETTER CHEQUE. Below is the information to send through Ria Money Transfer\ntoday? Receiver's Name.. DONBURO WAYLLA\nCountry.. Benin Republic\nCity..

And our Excellency the president has already signed the cheque. Today been the 14th of June\n2023 and he said I should notify and inform him when the check is posted. This $55.00 is the only thing delaying it. We will be waiting\nfor your call or email for the immediate procedure for the payment of your compensation fund CHEQUE.

I am glad to hear that my payment of Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is ready to be wired to me in cash.\n\nHowever, before proceeding further, I would like to clarify a few things:\n\n1. You mentioned that the only fee required by the CENTRAL BANK is for the ACTIVATION of the cheque. Could you please specify how much this fee is?\n\n2. You have asked for my home address to send the LETTERED BANK DRAFT CHEQUE. However, I would prefer if we could arrange a secure method for this transaction considering its large amount.\n\n3. Lastly, you mentioned about many imposters claiming people's funds. This concerns me greatly and I would appreciate if you could provide some form of assurance or proof that this transaction is legitimate and secure.\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nCeleste"
