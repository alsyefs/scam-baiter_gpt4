I appreciate your concern about the situation.\n\nI'm curious, could you please elaborate more on the role of the National Drug Law Agency in this matter? Also, what exactly does the NDLEA Fund Clearance entail?\n\nRegarding the fee, I would like to know more about how it is calculated and what it covers. Is there a specific deadline for this payment?\n\nLastly, you mentioned that Nigeria will be voting for a new government next year. How might this impact foreign payment currency policies? \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nDana"
