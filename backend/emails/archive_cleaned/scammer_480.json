Could you please explain more about what these fees are for? \n\nAlso, could you clarify what forms I need to fill out? You mentioned that I should attach them with my payment slip, but I'm not sure which forms these are.\n\nI appreciate your patience and look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nBetty"
