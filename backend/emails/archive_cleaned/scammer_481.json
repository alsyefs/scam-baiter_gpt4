        "body": "Hello Jennifer Burns,\n\nThank you so much for your message. It's really exciting to hear about this fund transfer! I'm just a bit confused about the process, could you please explain it a bit more? How does the Federal Reserve Payment System work exactly? And how did my Million USD end up there?\n\nAlso, you mentioned Mr. Tom Frank. Could you tell me more about his role in this process? Is he someone I should be contacting directly?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nJohn"
