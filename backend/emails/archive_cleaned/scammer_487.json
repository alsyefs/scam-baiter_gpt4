        "body": "Hello MR. J. OKUNTOLA,\n\nThank you for your email and the information provided. It's quite interesting to hear about this transfer of US Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit confused about the documents you mentioned. Could you please explain more about what the Fund Origin and Currency Payment Permit are? And why are they necessary for this transfer?\n\nAlso, could you provide more details on how to procure these documents? I would appreciate any guidance or assistance in this matter.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nCynthia"
