Khashaba and Alex Kummer ,one an Egyptian and American resident here in California walked free to notify me that you handed over power of attorney to them to claim this $25M on your behalf. They even came with authority insisting that you gave the money to settle all sundry expenses that will pose hinderance. As such they showed me the cash they intended to use for the completion of this transaction stating that due to your ill health of late that your paralysis will not allow to complete have been spending so much money on your health issue.\nAttached are their identifications which they presented and I had to scan for your perusal and get your confirmation that you actually authorised this process.\nTo me ,I believe they are impostors.\nKindly confirm that they are genuine and representing your interest.\nWaiting to hear from you urgently as I tried severally to call on your cellphone without success.\nBarrister Vincent Esq   "
