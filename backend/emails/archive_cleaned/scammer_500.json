I am indeed in good health and hope the same for you.\n\nHowever, I must express my confusion regarding your message. It seems there is some information missing which makes it difficult for me to understand the situation fully.\n\nCould you please provide more details about this abandoned shipment? What is its connection to me? And why has it been sent to the United Nations head office in New York?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nMinnie"
