        "body": "Hello Dr. Tony Anderson,\n\nThank you for your detailed message. I'm a bit confused about the process, but I'm trying to understand it better. So, if I got it right, you're suggesting that we should make the transfer to your Europe bank account instead of the USA HSBC bank account? \n\nAlso, could you please explain why the procedure with the bank draft from Germany will take three weeks? Is this a standard procedure or is there something specific about this case?\n\nI also noticed that you mentioned Turkey and Cyprus. Did you open the Europe bank account there? How does it help with tax reasons?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest wishes,\nLaura"
