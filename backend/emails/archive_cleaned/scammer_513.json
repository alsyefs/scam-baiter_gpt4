I was not expecting any package, let alone one containing a large sum of money. \n\nHowever, if you believe that this package is indeed intended for me, I would be happy to assist in any way possible to ensure its safe delivery.\n\nBefore we proceed, could you please provide more details about the package? Specifically, who is it from and why was it sent to me? Also, could you clarify what you mean by \"share the money\"? \n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nMichael"
