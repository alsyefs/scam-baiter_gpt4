However, I would like to understand more about it before making any commitments.\n\nCould you please provide more details about your client? What kind of business are they in? And what type of investment are they looking to make?\n\nAlso, could you clarify what you mean by \"you shall retain of the Investment Capital as your Commission\"? It seems like there might be a number missing there.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nAlbert"
