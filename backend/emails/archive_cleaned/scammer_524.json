That seems like a very unique arrangement.\n\nAlso, could you tell me more about the National Security Company and their role in this process? And who is the consultant banker that will meet with me?\n\nI appreciate your request for my full name and number, but I'd feel more comfortable sharing such information once I understand more about this situation. \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nRyann"
