I did not instruct her to do so, and I am certainly not deceased.\n\nPlease disregard any further communication from this individual claiming to be my next of kin or having any association with me. \n\nThank you for bringing this matter to my attention. Please ensure that my funds remain secure and do not transfer anything without my explicit consent.\n\nBest wishes,\nDavid"
