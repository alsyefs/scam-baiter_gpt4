It's refreshing to hear that this process is different from my previous experiences, and I appreciate your understanding.\n\nI'm intrigued by the project you mentioned, it sounds like a unique opportunity.

What kind of investments has he made in the past? \n\nYou mentioned that there will be no upfront fees required from me, which is reassuring. However, could you clarify what expenses the investor will cover? Will they cover all costs related to travel and accommodation?\n\nLastly, could you provide more details about the payment outlet where I'll need to sign the Final Funds Release Order Documents?
