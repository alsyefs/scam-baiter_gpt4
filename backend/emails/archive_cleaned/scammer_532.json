I am not sure how he could claim to be my next of kin as I have no relatives by that name. \n\nPlease do not release any funds to this person. I would appreciate it if you could provide me with more information about this situation.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\n\nBest wishes,\nMichael"
