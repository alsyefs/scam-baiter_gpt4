        "body": "Greetings dear friend,\n \nI Am Mr. Jozef Julien Etienne, a banker here in Belgium. I write you this very confidential proposal in good faith, hoping that I will rely on you. In 2010, Mr. Albert Guido, who hails from your country as his place of origin/birth made a fixed deposit, valued €28,750,000 (Twenty-Eight Million Seven Hundred and Fifty Thousand Euros) with our bank in Belgium. He was an oil merchant and an Engineering contractor.\n \nHe came here to Belgium for an Engineering work exploration from your country before he deposited his Swiss account in Switzerland. I was his account officer. Unfortunately, while on a business trip, he died in a deadly Tsunami earthquake that occurred in Sendai Japan on March 11, 2011, which killed many people.\n \nThe management of our bank has been sourcing for a means to reach him to ascertain if he would want to roll over the Deposit, or have the contract sum withdrawn, When I discovered that this would happen, I learned of his death, so I have tried to think up a procedure to preserve this fund and use the proceed for charity. Our Bank Managing director has been trying to find out the information about this account and the owner, but I have kept it closed to my heart because I know that if they become aware of his death, they will corner the funds for themselves and their private use and leave me with nothing.\n \nTherefore, I am seeking your cooperation to present you as the one to benefit from his fund at his death. So that my bank headquarters will pay the funds to you. I have made enough inside the bank arrangements already and I only have to put your details into the information network in the bank computers database and reflect you as his next of kin to the deceased Albert Guido.\n \nThis is a smooth and risk-free operation as long as no one else besides you and I know about this. I immensely request your optimum honesty and cooperation. Let me know your opinion on this, and please treat this information with utmost confidentiality. We will go over the details as soon as I receive your urgent response strictly through my email address, my email address is (\njozefes47@gmail.com\n)\n \nPlease observe this instruction religiously. I am a family man with a daughter. \nI am sending you this mail not without a measure of doubt as to what the consequences could be for me if my Bank finds out about my secret plan. Please let this be a top secret between us.\n \nThe sharing formula would be 45% for me, 45% for you, and then 10% for Charity.\nPlease let \"CONFIDENTIALITY\" be our watchword until success is achieved.\nBest Regards,\nMr. Jozef Julien Etienne"

I must say, your proposal is quite intriguing and it's not every day that one receives such an interesting offer. The story of Mr. Albert Guido is indeed tragic and it's commendable that you're trying to use his funds for charity.\n\nHowever, I'm curious about a few things. How did you come across my contact information? And why have you chosen me specifically for this task? Also, could you please provide more details about the charity we would be supporting?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nLee"

        "body": "Dear sir,\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your response. I'm delighted to hear that you're\r\nenthusiastic about our collaboration. I share your excitement and look\r\nforward to exploring the possibilities together. If you have any questions\r\nor concerns, please don't hesitate to ask me.\r\n\r\nI would like to introduce myself. My name is Jozef Julien Etienne. I am 48\r\nyears old, with a Belgian mother and a British father. I got married but\r\nunfortunately got divorced 4 years ago. I have an 11-year-old daughter\r\nnamed Nancy.\r\n\r\nI have worked in the financial sector for 22 years, starting when I was 26\r\nyears old. Recently, I came across an opportunity where the rightful owner\r\nof a fund, Mr. Albert Guido, had passed away without any beneficiaries or\r\nnext of kin listed on the account. As the account officer, I am the only\r\none who knows about this. I am not a greedy person, but I decided to take\r\nthis opportunity because if I hadn't, my bank's senior executives would\r\nhave taken the funds for themselves. I hope you understand the situation.\r\n\r\n\"I believe that mutual trust, respect, love, understanding, and\r\nconfidentiality are essential for us to work together effectively.\"\r\n\r\nI will start by adding your name as the next of kin and beneficiary to Mr.\r\nAlbert Guido's account. By doing this, you will be recognized as the only\r\nperson eligible to inherit the account. Once I add your name to our bank's\r\ndatabase, I will look for a reputable lawyer who can help you secure the\r\naffidavit of claim and change of ownership. This will give you the legal\r\nright to claim the fund with no issues.\r\n\r\nThere is no risk involved in the process. Therefore, you can be assured\r\nthat everything is safe and secure. As your assistant, I will handle all\r\nthe necessary documentation in the bank and send you the deposit\r\ncertificate with your name as the beneficiary. After that, we will contact\r\na lawyer who will represent you and help us obtain an affidavit of change\r\nof ownership from the National Court of Belgium, also known as the Court of\r\nCassation de Belgium. The affidavit that will be obtained through the\r\nlawyer will serve as protection for you when the fund arrives in your\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nWe have a mutually beneficial deal. We will split the fund of €28,750,000\r\n(Twenty-Eight Million Seven Hundred and Fifty Thousand Euros) equally\r\nbetween us as soon as it arrives in your account. 45% will be for me, 45%\r\nfor you, and 10% will be set aside for charity.\r\n\r\nProvide me with this information as follows With the scanned copy of your\r\nidentification:\r\n\r\n\r\nYOUR FULL NAME:\r\nMOBILE/WHATSAPP PHONE NUMBER:\r\nHOME OR OFFICE ADDRESS:\r\nOCCUPATION:\r\nMARITAL STATUS:\r\nYOUR MEANS OF IDENTIFICATION (ID):\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter I receive the information from you, I will make the necessary changes\r\nto the deposit certificate to include your name as the beneficiary of the\r\nfund. Once I have updated the certificate, I will send it to you. You can\r\nthen forward it to the bank to claim the funds. We will handle any response\r\nfrom the bank accordingly.\nRegards,\r\nJozef Julien Etienne"
