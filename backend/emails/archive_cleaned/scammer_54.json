        "body": "Hello Mrs. Gloria Uba,\n\nThank you for your message. It's quite interesting to hear about this unclaimed fund situation. I must admit, I'm not very familiar with the federal rules of law regarding such matters.\n\nCould you please explain a bit more about these rules? How does it usually work when someone has an unclaimed fund? And what is the purpose of the fee that needs to be paid?\n\nAlso, could you clarify what you mean by \"signing my ownership\"? What exactly would I be signing and why is it necessary?\n\nI appreciate your help in understanding this better.\n\nBest wishes,\nDoris"
