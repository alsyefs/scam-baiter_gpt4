Could you please explain it to me in simpler terms? \n\nYou mentioned two methods of payment - by check or ATM card. How does the ATM card work exactly? And how would I go about renewing it after 4 years?\n\nAlso, you mentioned something about a fee of $100. What is this fee for exactly? \n\nI'm sorry for all the questions, but I just want to make sure I understand everything correctly.\n\nLooking forward to your response!\n\nP.S: Please note that due to privacy concerns, I won't be able to provide my full name, phone number or address at this time.\n\nBest wishes,\nMichael"
