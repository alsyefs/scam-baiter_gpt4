        "body": "Hello Mr. IBE KACHIKWU CON,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. This is quite a surprise! I had no idea that someone was trying to claim my funds. It's really shocking to hear about this Mr. Qu Risheng and his actions.\n\nI'm curious, how did you manage to find out about this fraudulent activity? And what measures are being taken to prevent such incidents in the future?\n\nAs for the information you requested, I'm afraid I can't provide it at this time due to privacy concerns. However, I'd be more than happy to discuss further steps we can take together to resolve this issue.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nKathy"
