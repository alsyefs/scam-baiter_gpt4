        "body": "Hello there,\n\nThank you for your message. It's quite exciting to hear about this opportunity from the IMF and Federal Ministry of Finance in Benin Republic. I must say, it's not every day that one receives such news.\n\nI'm a bit confused though, could you please clarify a few things for me? You mentioned something about receiving USD daily until a certain amount is reached. Could you explain how this works?\n\nAlso, you mentioned a Tax Clearance fee that needs to be paid. Is this a common procedure? And why does it need to be sent through Western Union or Money Gram or Ria Transfer?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nSheila"
