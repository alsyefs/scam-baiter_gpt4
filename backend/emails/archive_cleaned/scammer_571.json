However, before I proceed with providing the requested information, I would like to clarify a few things.\n\nFirstly, could you please provide more details about the contract inheritance fund? How was it accrued and why has it been deposited in your bank?\n\nSecondly, could you please explain the process of setting up a Personal Banking Account? What are the benefits of this account and are there any associated fees?\n\nLastly, could you please provide more information about your bank's security measures? As you mentioned, scam activities are rampant these days and I want to ensure that my personal information will be safe.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nDiana"
