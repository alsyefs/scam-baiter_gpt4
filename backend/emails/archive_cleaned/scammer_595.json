I am very excited about this opportunity to live and work in the United States! \n\nCould you please provide more details on the next steps I need to take? Also, could you confirm if there are any restrictions on where I can live in the US once I have my green card?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards,\nLewis D.\n\nBest wishes,\nEvelyn"
