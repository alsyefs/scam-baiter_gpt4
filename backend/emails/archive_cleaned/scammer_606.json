Could you please provide more details about this? \n\nAlso, regarding the clearance fee, could you please clarify why this wasn't taken care of before the package was shipped? It seems unusual that such a fee would be requested upon arrival.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nRobert"
