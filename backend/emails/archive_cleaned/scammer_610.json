It's quite surprising to hear about the situation, especially considering the involvement of so many high-profile organizations.\n\nI'm curious, how did you come across my case specifically? And could you please elaborate on the process that led to this resolution?\n\nAlso, I would like to know more about these \"imposters\" you mentioned. How were they able to delay my payment and what measures are being taken to prevent such incidents in the future?\n\nRegarding the transfer of funds, it's great news that it will be done via CITIBANK EUROPE Plc in Ireland. However, I'm a bit confused about why my personal banking details need to be forwarded. Could you explain this further?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nWayne"
