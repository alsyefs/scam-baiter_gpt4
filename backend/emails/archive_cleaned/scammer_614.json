It may interest you to know that reports have reached our office by so many correspondences on the uneasy way which people like you are treated by Various Banks and Courier Companies/ Diplomat across Europe to Africa and Asia /London Uk and we have decided to put a stop to that and that is why I was appointed to handle your transaction here in\nU/K and U.S.A\nAll Governmental and Non-Governmental prostates, NGOs, Finance Companies, Banks, Security Companies and Courier companies which have been in contact with you of late have been instructed to back up from your transaction and you have been advised NOT to respond to them anymore since the IMF is now directly in charge of your payment.\nThe most annoying thing is that the bad officials won't tell you the truth that on no account will they ever release the fund to you, instead they allow you spend money unnecessarily, I do not intend to work here all the days of my life, I can release this fund to you if you can certify me of my security.\nI hope this is clear. Any action contrary to this instruction is at your own risk. Respond to this e-mail on ( \nofficice6@gmail.com\n) with immediate effect and we shall give you further details on how your fund\nwill be released.\n1.Full Name:.........\n2.Address:..........\n3.Nationality:......\n4.Age:........Date of Birth:...........\n5.Occupation:............\n6.Phone:...............Mobile: .............:................ ...\n7.State of Origin:......................Country:.................\n8.

        "body": "Hello Franks Jeffrey,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, your message is quite intriguing and it's interesting to know that the IMF is now directly in charge of my payment. \n\nHowever, I'm a bit confused about some parts of your message. Could you please clarify what you mean by \"All and prostates\"? Also, when you mention that bad officials won't release the fund to me, could you elaborate on who these officials are?\n\nI'm also curious about why my security is a concern for releasing this fund? Could you provide more details on this?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest wishes,\nWarren"
