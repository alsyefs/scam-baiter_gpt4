It's a great way to start the new year, isn't it? \n\nI watched the videos of the other winners and they seem very happy. Can you tell me more about how they received their winnings? Did they have to go somewhere to collect it or was it delivered to them?\n\nAlso, I'm curious about how my email was selected. Can you explain more about this Automated Database Random selection Program? How often does it run and how many people usually win?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest wishes,\nJennifer"
