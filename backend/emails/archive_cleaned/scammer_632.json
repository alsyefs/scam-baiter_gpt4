I must admit, I'm a bit surprised by your message as I wasn't aware of any accrued interest funds in my name. Could you please provide more details about this? How did these funds come to be and why are they associated with my name?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nMelanie"
