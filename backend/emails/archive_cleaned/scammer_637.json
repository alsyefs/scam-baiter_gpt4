I must say, it's quite a surprise to hear about the lottery win and the box containing such a large sum of money.\n\nI'm curious though, how did my email address get selected for this award? And could you please provide more details about the person who was arrested claiming to be my sister? I don't recall sending anyone to claim any money on my behalf.\n\nAlso, could you explain why I need to purchase a Steam Wallet Gift Card or Amazon card? How does that relate to getting the box delivered to me?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nMichael"
