        "body": "Dear Ambassador Chimezie Emeka,\n\nThank you for your email and the information provided. I am indeed surprised to hear about this unclaimed fund. However, I would like to clarify a few things before we proceed.\n\nFirstly, could you please provide more details about the origin of these funds? How did my name come up in connection with them?\n\nSecondly, I understand that you will be bringing the package personally, but I would like to know more about the registration process of an ambassadorial package and why there is a fee involved.\n\nLastly, could you please provide some form of official documentation or proof regarding this matter? This is simply for my personal records and assurance.\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nBetty"
