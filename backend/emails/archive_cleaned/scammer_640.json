I am very much alive and capable of managing my own affairs.\n\nI have no knowledge of the pending fund valued at TWO MILLION US DOLLARS you mentioned in your email. Furthermore, I did not sign any document making Ms. Alexandre or anyone else the current Next of Kin to receive any funds.\n\nPlease disregard any claims made by Ms. Alexandre or anyone else purporting to act on my behalf without my explicit written consent.\n\nThank you for bringing this matter to my attention.\n\nBest wishes,\nRonnie"
