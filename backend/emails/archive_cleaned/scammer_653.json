        "body": "Hello Mr. Nicolas Jackson,\n\nThank you for your detailed email and the warm welcome to Dancol Financial Group. I appreciate the time you've taken to outline the terms and conditions of the loan.\n\nI have a few questions, if you don't mind. Could you please clarify what exactly the Security Charges are? And how much would they be for a loan of this size? Also, could you explain more about the Insurance Approval Charges that the lender will cover?\n\nRegarding repayment, is there an option to make bi-annual payments instead of monthly or yearly ones? \n\nLastly, I'm not sure I understand what signing below on this document means in an email context. Could you please explain that process?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nLaura"
