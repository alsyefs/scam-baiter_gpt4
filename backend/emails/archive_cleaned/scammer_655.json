It's always great to hear about new investment groups expanding their global presence. \n\nCould you please provide more information about the types of projects your group is interested in?

What kind of criteria does a project need to meet in order to be considered viable by your group?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nTim"
