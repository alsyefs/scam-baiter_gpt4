Could you please provide more details about this? How was my name selected and what is the purpose of these funds?\n\nAlso, could you explain a bit more about the interbank cashier cheque process? I'm not very familiar with it.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nCecil"
