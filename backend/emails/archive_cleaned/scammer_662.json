I reside here in Spring City, Pennsylvania. My residential address is as follows. 3663 Schuylkill Rd# 1, Spring City, Pennsylvania, United States, am thinking of relocating since I am now rich. I am one of those that took part in the Compensation in Troy Illinois many years ago and they refused to pay me, I had paid over $52,000 while in the United States trying to get my payment\nall to no avail.\n \n \nI decided to travel down to Troy Illinois with all my compensation documents and i was directed to meet Mr.James Richard he is among the member of the COMPENSATION AWARD COMMITTEE, I contacted him and he explained everything to me. He said whoever is contacting us through emails are fake because the Inheritance/Compensation Law clearly states that the beneficiary/recipient is exempt from paying any out of pocket fees or charges to receive said funds. Mr.James Richard took me to the paying bank for the claim of my Compensation payment. Right now I am the happiest woman on earth because I have received my compensation funds of $9,500,000.00 (nine million five hundred thousand dollars).\n \n \nMoreover, Mr.James Richard showed me the full information of those that are yet to receive their payments and I saw your name and email address as one of the beneficiaries that is why I decided to email you to stop dealing with those people, they are not with your funds, they are only making money out of you. I will advise you to contact Mr.James Richard you have to contact him directly on this information below.\n \n \nCOMPENSATION AWARD HOUSE\nName: Mr.James Richard\nEmail: \njamesrichard11511@gmail.com\n \n \nListed below are the name of mafias and banks behind the non release of your funds that I managed to sneak out for your kind perusal.\n1) Prof. Charles soludo\n2) Senator David Mark\n2) Micheal Edward\n3) Chief Joseph Sanusi\n3) Sanusi Lamido\n4) Dr. R. Rasheed\n5) Mr. David Koffi\n6) Barrister Awele Ugorji\n7) Mr. Roland Ngwa\n8) Barrister Ucheuzo Williams\n9) Mr. Ernest Chukwudi Obi\n10) Dr. Patrick Aziza Deputy Governor - Policy / Board Member\n11) Mr. Tunde Lemo Deputy Governor - Financial Sector\nSurveillance/Board Member\n12) Mrs. W. D. A. Mshelia Deputy Governor - Corporate Services / Board\nMembers\n13) Mrs. Okonjo Iweala\n14) Mrs. Rita Ekwesili\n15) Barr Jacob Onyema\n16) Dr. Godwin Oboh: Director Union Bank Of Nigeria.\n17) Mr. John Collins: Global Diplomat Director.\n18) Foreign fund diplomatic courier\n19) Barr. Becky Owens\n20) Rev. Steven Jones\n21) Mr. Alfred james\n22) Mrs. Sherry Williams\n23) Mr. Scott Larry\n24) Mr. Names: STEVEN T MNUCHIN  FROM US TREASURY DEPARTMENT\nYou really have to stop dealing with those people that are contacting you and telling you that your fund is with them, it is not in anyway with them, they are only taking advantage of you and they will dry you up until you have nothing. The only money I paid after I met James Richard was just $300 for the delivery charges, take note of that.\n \n \n(NOTE: TELLING YOU TO PAY FOR ANY DELIVERY OR COURIER CHARGE IS ALL NOTHING BUT LIES, I REPEAT THE ONLY MONEY YOU WILL HAVE TO PAY AND WHICH I ALSO PAID IS $300 FOR THE DELIVERY CHARGES IMPOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND YOUR PACKAGE CONTAINING YOUR CERTIFIED BANK DRAFT CHEQUE WILL BE REACHING YOU THROUGH THE EXPRESS COURIER SERVICE).\n \n \nOnce again stop contacting those people, I will advise you to contact Mr.James Richard so that he can help you to deliver your funds instead of dealing with those liars that will be turning you around asking for different kind of money to complete your transaction.\n \n \nMrs. CYNDY BANKS   "
