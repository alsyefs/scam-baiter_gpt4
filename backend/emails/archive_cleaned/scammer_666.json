Could you please provide more details about this contract? How did my name come up in relation to these funds?\n\nAlso, could you explain a bit more about the process of receiving the funds in two or three parts? It sounds like an interesting option but I would like to understand it better.\n\nI'm not very familiar with buying gift cards or using WU or MG for transactions. Could you guide me through that process as well?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nMaureen"
