I\ndonâ€™t want to hand the project to the government I prefer an\nindividual who will reach out to the less privilege. This is my reason\nfor contacting you not by mistake but by divine direction.\nDue to the state of my health my doctors does not allow me to make use\nof any phone they only give me access to my laptop which I use once in\na while. So,we can always communicate by email.\nFrom the total fund, you will use 20% as gratification while 80%\nshould go to the less privilege but if you feel otherwise do not\nhesitate to notify me.\nI will need your passport or any identification document. As soon as I\nreceive your passport or any identification document I will have no\ndoubt that you are genuine and ready to work with me thus I shall\nrefer you to the British bank.\nFind attached copies of my photos.\nMost cordially,\nMrs.Janet Robertson "

        "body": "Hello Robertson,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I'm deeply moved by your story and your desire to help the less privileged. It's truly admirable that even in your current state, you're thinking of others.\n\nI have a few questions if you don't mind. Could you please share more about the project? What kind of assistance do the less privileged need? And how can I be of help?\n\nRegarding the passport or any document, I'm afraid I can't provide them due to privacy reasons. However, rest assured that my intentions are genuine and I'm ready to assist in any way possible.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nCharles"
