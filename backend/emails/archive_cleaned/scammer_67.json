Could you please explain a bit more about what a bank draft is and why it was deposited with the Apex Courier Delivery Company in Senegal?\n\nAlso, could you clarify what the Security Keeping Fee is for? Is it a standard fee for all deliveries or does it vary depending on the package?\n\nI appreciate your help in understanding this process better.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nCharles"
