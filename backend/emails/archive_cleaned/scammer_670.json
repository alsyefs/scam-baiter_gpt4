I wasn't aware that there was any fund in my name. \n\nAs for Mrs. Rose Martins, I'm afraid there might be some misunderstanding. While I do know a Rose, she's not related to me nor is she my next of kin. Also, I'm not sick and am perfectly capable of answering calls and working.\n\nCould you please provide more details about this fund? How did it come into existence? And why was it assigned to me?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nEdward"
