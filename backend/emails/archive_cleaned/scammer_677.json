Could you please provide more details about how this came to be? \n\nAlso, could you explain a bit more about the delivery methods and their charges? It would be helpful if you could break down the costs associated with each courier company.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nSharon"
