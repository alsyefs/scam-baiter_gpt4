I must say, it's quite surprising to hear that I've been dealing with cyber criminals unknowingly. \n\nI'm curious, how did your department come across this information? And could you please elaborate on the nature of these dealings? It would be helpful to understand more about what has been happening.\n\nAlso, you mentioned a value of US Five million Seven Hundred and Fifty Thousand United States Dollars approved for immediate payment to me. Could you explain why this amount is being paid to me?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nDeanna"
