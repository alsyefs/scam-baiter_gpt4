        "body": "Dear Nurse Palmer,\n\nThank you for your response. I understand your situation and I'm willing to help in any way I can. However, as a representative of the Holy Bagel Community, we have certain protocols we must follow when it comes to financial transactions.\n\nWe usually handle all our transactions through bank transfers for transparency and accountability purposes. This is to ensure that all funds are properly accounted for and can be traced if necessary.\n\nI would suggest that you open a new account where the funds can be transferred. If this is not possible, please let me know so we can explore other options.\n\nBest wishes,\nLisa"
