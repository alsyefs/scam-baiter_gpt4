I am glad to inform you that I have successfully concluded the transaction, the money transferred to Japan. It was transferred through the assistant Mr. Howard Ferraro who is a Japanese base business man.\nHowever, I did not forget you because you are the source of my success, you made me what I am now though you are not there to complete this project with me but I gave all the credit and thanks to you. I know it was not your fault or rather your wish to back up on me and the transaction, I understood it was simply because of what you must have heard about business opportunities like this. Actually there are still good ones for example myself.\nIn appreciate of your assistance I have mapped out as a compensation and wrote on your favor a Draft worth of US$5,000,000.00.(Five Million United States Dollars Only) I left the Draft with my attorney Sir. Jerry Koffi on my departure to Japan. I would like you therefore, to contact him on the below info so that he can release it to you.\nAttn: Sir. Jerry Koffi\nEmail: \njerrykoffi77@yahoo.com\nContact my Attorney in Dubai - UAE so that he can release your Draft to you. I will stop here. Once again, thank you very much and remain blessed.\nRegards,\nSule Gratin"
