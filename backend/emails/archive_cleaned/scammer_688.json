I am looking for a\nconfidant, someone to help fulfill my last wish. Hope to read from you. I will appreciate your selfless act towards the less privilege, I donâ€™t mind if you could be of trustful help. I will be waiting to read from you urgently as time is of essence due the limited time I have and my ill health condition.\nThanks,\nStephen  "
