I'm a bit confused about some parts of your message though, could you please clarify?\n\nYou mentioned contacting Western Union for directions on receiving the funds daily. Could you provide more details on how this works? \n\nAlso, you mentioned an agreement for a certain amount daily until the whole amount is transferred. Could you specify what this total amount is?\n\nLastly, you mentioned a contact person named Elias and a fee for renewal of transfer fund file. Could you explain more about who Elias is and what this fee is for?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest wishes,\nCarlos"
