It hurts to find how\nindividuals could pronounce their fellow human dead just to deceive\nthe authorities to steal what does not rightfully belong to them. It’s\na shame to say the least.\nSince they have already paid all the fees and bring the file to\nsettlement stage, I believe that this is the best time for you to\nstrike and stay at an advantageous position more than ever before. So\nI want to guide you on how to quickly stop this criminality and also\nput the perpetrators behind bars while your fund is released to you as\nthe rightful owner.\nFor security reasons I would have loved to remain anonymous for now\nuntil you reply. However, doing that would be unprofessional, but\nplease endeavor to hide my identity as I assist you in this\ntransaction so I don’t get hurt or killed. Furthermore, kindly tell me\nin clear terms what you would do for me once we succeed in recovering\nthis claim and get the fund release to you without wasting much time.\nI await your reply for more details.\nDR, Usman Wakalia\nThe New Executive payment  "

I must say, it's quite a surprise to hear that someone is trying to claim my funds under the false pretense of my demise. \n\nI'm curious, how did you come across this information? And what steps do we need to take in order to rectify this situation? I'm eager to ensure that my funds are secure and not misappropriated by anyone else.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nArielle"
