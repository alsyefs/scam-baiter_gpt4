I can tell from all\nindications you’re very sincere and a good person. I’m Captain\nAnderson Frank of \nthe US Army currently in Ukraine as a solo\nsurveillance intelligence to the US government on Russia invasion to\nUkraine.\nOn this, I contacted you to know if you can be a trusted person to me,\nit’s very obvious you’re aware of what is going on in UKRAINE as the\nRussian government is invading KIVY, the country’s capital, this\ninvasion has brought  the UKRAINE Economy down. Due to my call of duty\nas Solo Surveillance intelligence to the US government I was\nopportuned to have a private discussion with the UKRAINE finance\nminister Mr. Serhiy Marchenko in this discussion, he trusted in me the\nchance to move out  the Sum of $2,000 000 USD (TWO MILLION UNITED\nSTATES DOLLARS ) in my name through a Courier Service as it’s the only\nway out because no banks is functioning at the moment, after which I\nhelped him secure an important security bilateral relationship with\nNATO finance department. So I need your full name, complete address,\nand phone number, copy of your I’D Card or passport to proceed with\nthis deal through a Delivery courier company called FIRST JET COURIER\nINC.\nMr. Serhiy Marchenko, However, he vowed to give me maximum protection\nafter this deal, as he has the power to wipe out the currency data\nfrom the UKRAINE CENTRAL BANK. So\n this is a RISKY free transaction\n. As\nfor the percentage, the  deal is a 50/50 percentage as I would not\nwant you to betray me on this once I push this funds to you through\nthe courier services.\nKindly get back to me as soon as possible if you're interested in this\ndeal,I wait to hear from you.\nRegards Captain Anderson."
