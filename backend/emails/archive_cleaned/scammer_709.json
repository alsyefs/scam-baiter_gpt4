        "body": "SUPREME COURT OF UNITED STATES.\n1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW Washington DC 20500. The USA.\nFrom: John Glover Roberts Jr,\nChief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States\nGood day to you...\nI am John Glover Roberts Jr, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. I would like to inform you that your fund issue worth the total sum of $5.5Million US Dollars was brought to my office this morning to cancel by Mr. Charles W. Scharf the Chief Executive Officer WELLS FARGO BANK USA.\nThen, I asked what are the conditions but I was told that because of your inability to secure the required Affidavit of claim Ownership so that the US Monitory Fund Investigation Union head office in Washington DC capital the United State of America will declare your payment free from any money laundry and terrorism drug money sponsor activities to enable our service have the authority of releasing the payment to you and register it with US MAILING POST for over-night delivery to your address without-delay.\nBut I told him to wait because there is no need to cancel the payment and that I will do my very best to bring the issue to a conclusion. To the best of my knowledge and humanitarian ground and sympathy. I immediately called up the new President Mr. Joe Biden and US Senate committees and explained your matter to them. We understand that the imposed fee of $325 of Affidavit of Claim Ownership might be too much for you to pay now, So we further make things easier for you by discussing with new President Mr.Joe Biden  and the US Senate committee on your behalf.\nThey have given you the grace of sending only $25 to enable you to afford this only fee after the Diplomatic Agent delivers your ATM Visa Card to you, then once you confirm your $5.5Million US Dollars, you can then pay the remaining balance of $300.\n All we want you to do right now is to go ahead buy a $25 iTunes card or Apple card\nWallet for immediately issuing the needed Affidavit of claim Ownership\n to enable the Diplomat to make the delivery to your home address today. I advise you to send the required $25 to secure the Affidavit of Claim Ownership to enable them to ship your ATM Card that is worth $5.5Million US Dollars to regain your financial freedom and have enough money to live on and establish a good business for yourself and your family. But if you don't need it then I can change your name to another person to receive the fund on your behalf so that this Government will not claim this money but I know that you will love to have it. The ATM package will be successfully safely delivered within 7-hours/ without any hitches or delays. Therefore, I will advise you to go ahead and buy a $25 Apple card or iTunes card because it is the only problem we have on finalizing the assignment on your behalf. Please quickly run now to buy the iTunes card to secure the Affidavit of claim Ownership which will show that the transaction was made through the full capacity of the Government and will not be queried for certain circumstances.\nAll necessary official modalities are being finalized in your favor. Send the $25 Apple card or iTunes card so we can direct it to the right office imposition to release the document. And immediately you make the payment to them the document will sign and your ATM parcel will deliver to your address without delay.\nPlease, I want you to know that you have from now till the end of two days to send the $25 iTunes card or Apple card to receive your ATM package worth $5.5Million US Dollar. Therefore, the days of you being subjected to paying twice Double Payment is over as that is the case with some corrupt officials down there in Africa.\nThis is a lifetime opportunity and we will advise you to take advantage of it before it will become too late to do so. This could be the last opportunity you might have in receiving your ATM package so do not fail to notice this wonderful moment to have your fund that you have been looking for a way to make it a reality.

        "body": "Hello Chief Justice John Glover Roberts Jr,\n\nWow, this is quite a surprise! I never expected to receive an email from someone as important as you. I'm just a simple person, so this is all a bit overwhelming for me.\n\nI must say, the idea of receiving such a large sum of money is very exciting. But I'm not sure I understand everything correctly. Could you please explain what the Affidavit of Claim Ownership is? And why do I need to buy an Apple card or another card?\n\nAlso, could you tell me more about how my name came up in relation to this fund? It's all very unexpected and I'd like to understand it better.\n\nThank you for your patience with my questions. Looking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nDavid"
