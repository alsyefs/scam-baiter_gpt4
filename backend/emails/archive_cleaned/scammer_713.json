If you have not asked\nthis question or you do\nnot know, this is an opportunity for me to tell you because enough is enough.\nFew years ago, some men who claim to be year partners, {I mean the\npeople that introduced you to the project} approached me through my\ndear wife and requested me to assist them conclude a money transfer\ndeal they had with you. They requested me to assist them by removing\nthe original contractors name{ Engr. Thomas Heywood}\ncompanyâ€™s name and bank particulars from the Central Bank of Nigeria\n(CBN) vetting computer and replacing them with your name and your bank\ndetails in order to make you appear as the rightful beneficiary of\nthis fund. I agreed on condition that they will pay me US$700,000 as\nsoon as your name appears as the beneficiary.\nAfter I succeeded in programming your name, all of a sudden, I did\nnot hear from them again till date.\nBased on their attitude, I decided to stop the fund release movement\nbecause I was not sure of their intention anymore as it might affect\nmy job.\nSecondly, I know the source of the funds that you did not execute any\ncontract in Nigeria, although I am the only person privileged to know\nthis information and it is a fact. Why I am making this clear to you\nis because I can see that you are still making efforts in order to\nconclude this project and have spent so much money without anything to\nshow for it.\nI therefore need your assurance that those colleagues of yours will be\ntotally kept out of this transaction till confirmation of this fund is\nmade via swift.\nI know that none of them is aware of my new approach to you. I\npersonally did the work at the beginning and it is only me who can\nmake the swift a huge success if you agree to work with me\nconfidentially.\nI am a man of my word. If you are ready to conclude this business with\nme, contact me on my mobile phone +234-0130994793 so that we can work\nout the best ways of bringing this to a successful and favorable\nconclusion.\nYours truly,\nDR.JOHN PEDRO.\nEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR SWIFT/WIRE TRANSFER DEPT {CBN}   "

        "body": "Hello Pedro,\n\nThank you for reaching out and sharing this information with me. I must say, it's quite a surprise to hear about all these behind-the-scenes happenings. \n\nI'm curious though, how did you manage to replace the original name with mine in the Central Bank of Nigeria's vetting computer? That sounds like a complex process.\n\nAlso, could you please elaborate on what you mean by \"making the swift huge success\"? I'm not entirely sure I understand that part.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nSonya"
