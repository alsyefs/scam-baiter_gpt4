I am glad to hear that my payment file has been reconciled and that I am the beneficiary of such a substantial amount.\n\nI understand from your email that an ATM Debit Card will be issued in my name, loaded with the funds, and delivered to my postal address.

Could you please provide more details about the process of activating the card once it is received?\n2. Are there any fees associated with this service that I should be aware of?\n3. How long can I expect it to take for the card to arrive at my address?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nTracie"
