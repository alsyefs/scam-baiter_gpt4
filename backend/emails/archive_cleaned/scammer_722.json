I must say, it's a very generous gesture.\n\nHowever, before proceeding further, could you please provide me with more details about this scheme? How was it decided who would be the beneficiaries of this fund? Also, how did you get my contact information?\n\nI'm looking forward to hearing more about this. \n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nBrian"
