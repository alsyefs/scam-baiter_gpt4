        "body": "Hello John Rowlands,\n\nThank you for reaching out and for the work you do in combating cyber fraud. It's reassuring to know that there are agencies like yours working tirelessly to protect us from these criminal activities.\n\nIn response to your questions, I have been approached by individuals with suspicious intentions online, but I can't say for certain if they were scams. I've never filed a complaint because I wasn't sure who to report it to or if it was serious enough.\n\nAs for the average amount, well, they usually ask for varying amounts. Some have asked for small amounts while others have asked for larger sums. \n\nThe methods used have varied as well. Some claimed to be business proposals while others were lottery-related.\n\nI'm afraid I don't have any emails or documents related to these incidents as I tend not to keep such correspondences due to their suspicious nature.\n\nI hope this information is helpful in your investigations. Please let me know if there's anything else you need from me.\n\nBest wishes,\nPatricia"
