I guaranteed a successful delivery to your\naddress without stoppage by any authority.\nTherefore you are to obtain Customs Clearance Bond which will be\nattached, to confirm that the consignment has been duly checked and\ncleared against financial crime and as such is not subject to further\ninspection by the Customs in your state before delivery to your\naddress. It will cost you $2,011 to obtain Customs Clearance Bond .\nIn God We Trust\nMiss Joy Eke   "
