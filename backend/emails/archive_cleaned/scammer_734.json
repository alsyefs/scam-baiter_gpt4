I must say, I'm quite surprised to hear about Mr. Zodik Mohammed and Mr Rasheed Abdul's visit to your office. \n\nI don't recall authorizing any changes to my account, especially not a diversion of funds. Could you please provide more details about this situation? What exactly did these gentlemen request? And how did they justify their request?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nLinda"
