        "body": "Hello Captain from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA,\n\nWow! Your message really took me by surprise. I'm not used to receiving such interesting emails. It's nice to meet you, even if it is just over the internet.\n\nI'm intrigued by your mention of a strong sensation and inner voice. That sounds quite mystical and fascinating. I've always been interested in spiritual matters, so it's great to hear from someone who seems to have a deep connection with their own spirit.\n\nIt's also wonderful to hear that you're a kind and respectful person. The world could certainly use more people like that!\n\nAs for your question about what I do for a living, well, let's just say I keep myself busy with various activities. I prefer not to go into too much detail about my personal life online though.\n\nYou mentioned having something important to share in your next email? That sounds intriguing! Can you give me a hint about what it might be?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nJohn"
