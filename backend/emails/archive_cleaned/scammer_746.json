I am glad to hear that efforts are being made to compensate victims of scams.\n\nHowever, before proceeding further, I would like to clarify a few things:\n\n1. Could you please provide more details about this compensation program? Who is eligible and what are the criteria for selection?\n\n2. You mentioned an ATM Master Card - could you explain how this works? Is it a prepaid card with the compensation amount loaded onto it?\n\n3. Regarding the EMS Express Courier, could you provide their contact details? The email address seems to be missing from your message.\n\n4. Lastly, you mentioned a parcel number that needs to be quoted when contacting EMS Express Courier. Could you please provide this number?\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nGeorge"
