I appreciate your trust in reaching out to me regarding this matter.\n\nIt's quite interesting that your father had such a substantial fund in a security firm. Could you tell me more about it? What kind of investment was he involved in?\n\nAlso, could you provide more details about the process of transferring these funds? How does having a foreign partner help in this situation?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nErin"
