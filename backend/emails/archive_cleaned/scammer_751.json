        "body": "Hello Mr. Kelvin Williams,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me and providing such detailed information about this exciting opportunity. I must say, it's not every day that one receives a message about a substantial sum of money!\n\nI'm curious, how was my name selected for this? And could you please explain more about the Monetary Funds External Auditors Committee? It sounds like an important organization.\n\nAlso, I noticed that you mentioned some codes like Exclusive Reference Number IMF Transfer Allocation No., Password Pin Code of Merit No., Release Code No., and Secret Code. Could you kindly elaborate on what these codes are used for?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nSteven"
