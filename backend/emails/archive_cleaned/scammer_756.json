        "body": "Hello Mr. Kenny,\n\nThank you for reaching out and providing such detailed information about the two trunk boxes. It's quite fascinating to hear about these developments, especially considering the involvement of such esteemed organizations like the United Nations and the World Bank.\n\nI'm curious though, how did my name come up in relation to these boxes? I don't recall having any dealings that would result in such a large sum of money being associated with me. Could you perhaps provide more context or details about this?\n\nAlso, regarding your request for me to come down to your airport or use a courier service, I'd like to understand better how this process works. What are the steps involved? And what kind of courier companies do you usually work with?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nMarian"
