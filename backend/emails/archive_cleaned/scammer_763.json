        "body": "Hello KRISTALINA IVANOVA GEORGIEVA,\n\nWow, this is quite a surprise! I'm just an ordinary person and didn't expect to be involved in such a big matter. It's really nice of you to reach out and help people like me.\n\nI'm curious about these gentlemen who visited your office. Could you tell me more about them? What did they look like? And how did they prove that I sent them?\n\nAlso, could you explain a bit more about these documents they tendered? What exactly is a 'Letter of', 'High court', and 'Order to release'? I'm not very familiar with these terms.\n\nYou mentioned that my funds are ready for payment. That sounds exciting but also a bit confusing. How did I come to have such a large sum of money? \n\nLastly, you asked for some personal information. I'm sorry but I don't feel comfortable sharing those details over email. Is there another way we can verify my identity?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nCharles"
