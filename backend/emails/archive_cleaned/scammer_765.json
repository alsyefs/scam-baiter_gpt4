I don't recall authorizing Mrs. Gertrude Smith to receive any contract payment on my behalf. Could you please provide more details about this contract? \n\nAlso, I'm curious as to how Mrs. Smith came into the picture? Did she claim to know me or did she provide any specific information that led you to believe she was my partner?\n\nI appreciate your patience and look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nHector"
