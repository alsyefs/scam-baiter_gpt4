        "body": "Hello Ms. Eden R. Jons,\n\nThank you for your email and the information provided. It's good to know that my fund has been deposited safely in Belgium by the IMF.\n\nI'm a bit confused about the service fee though. Could you please explain more about why it can't be deducted from my fund? I understand that my fund has been insured, but I'm not quite clear on how this relates to the service fee.\n\nAlso, could you provide more details about how I should send the service fee through Steam Wallet Gift Card or Google play card? I've never used these services before so any guidance would be appreciated.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nLuz"
