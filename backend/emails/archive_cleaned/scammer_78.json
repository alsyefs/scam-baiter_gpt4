You can also receive through cash delivery as the last solution before the last day of this month and year.\nReply immediately with your details which include your house and office address, mobile phone number, ID and the amount you are expecting to receive so that we can finalize within three to four days depending how fast you are to respond with your details. Your delay will only indicate you are not interested and willing to receive your money.\nBest regards\nRandy Terry\nPersonal assistant to Antonio Guterres\nUnited Nations Secretary General   "
