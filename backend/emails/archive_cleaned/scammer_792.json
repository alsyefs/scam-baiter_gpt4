        "body": "Hello there,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, this is quite a surprise! I don't recall having any dealings with Mrs. Glenda F. Ward or authorizing her to claim any funds on my behalf. It's quite peculiar, isn't it? \n\nI'm also not terminally ill, thank goodness! So that part of the information is definitely incorrect. \n\nCould you please provide more details about this fund? How did it come into existence and why is it associated with my name? Also, could you explain what the World Debt Recovery Committee does?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nGene"
