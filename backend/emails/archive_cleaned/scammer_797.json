I'm glad to know that you're doing well in Japan and that your partner, Mrs. ko Kamikawa, has recovered from the virus. That's indeed a reason to give praise.\n\nI remember our previous interactions and although we couldn't achieve our aim at that time, it was an interesting experience for me. You mentioned about an ATM VISA CARD kept by your secretary Mrs. lj for me? That's quite generous of you!\n\nCould you please tell me more about this card? How can I get in touch with Mrs. lj? And what should I expect once I receive this card?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nMichael"
