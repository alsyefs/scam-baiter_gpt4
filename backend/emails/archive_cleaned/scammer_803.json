I appreciate your concern and advice regarding my dealings with people from Nigeria. \n\nHowever, I would like to clarify that I have not been involved in any contracts in Nigeria or any other transactions that you mentioned in your email.

If there's anything else you need from me, feel free to ask.\n\nBest wishes,\nTracy"
