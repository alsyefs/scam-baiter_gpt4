        "body": "Dear Lyon Major,\n\nThank you for your email regarding the Stimulus Check payment. I am glad to hear that I am eligible for this grant. However, I would like to clarify a few things before proceeding.\n\nFirstly, could you please provide more details about the need for a Google Play Card or Steam Gift Card? It is unusual for official government transactions to require these types of gift cards as payment methods.\n\nSecondly, could you please confirm the exact amount of the stimulus check and how it will be delivered? You mentioned both a cashier's check and a credit card upload - which one will it be?\n\nLastly, could you please provide some official documentation or reference number related to this stimulus grant? This would help me verify the authenticity of this grant.\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nJune"
