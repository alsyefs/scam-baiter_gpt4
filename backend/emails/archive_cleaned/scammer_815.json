        "body": "Hello Mr. Harvey Terence,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. Your email certainly caught my attention, it's not every day that one receives such an intriguing proposition.\n\nI must admit, I'm a bit confused about the whole situation. Could you please clarify a few things for me? \n\nFirstly, how did you come across my contact information and why did you choose me for this task? I'm just an ordinary person with no special skills or connections in banking or finance.\n\nSecondly, could you explain more about the process of transferring these funds? I have never been involved in such a large transaction before and would like to understand how it works.\n\nLastly, what kind of assistance do you need from me exactly? You mentioned that I should receive the money in my bank account but is there anything else that I need to do?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nWillie"
