It's indeed a noble thought to donate your wealth for the betterment of less privileged people in our society.\n\nHowever, I would like to clarify that I am not equipped to handle such a large sum of money or oversee its distribution. I recommend reaching out to established charitable organizations who have the necessary resources and experience in managing funds and ensuring they reach those in need.\n\nI wish you strength and peace during this difficult time.\n\nBest wishes,\nJack"
