Your proposal sounds quite interesting and I appreciate the trust you've placed in me.\n\nCould you please provide more details about the loan investment? For instance, what is the interest rate for the loan? And how long is the duration of years for this agreement?\n\nAlso, could you clarify what you mean by \"disburse funds according to the individual company's capacity\"? How would that work exactly?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nRuth"
