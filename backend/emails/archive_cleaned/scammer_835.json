It is unusual for official transactions to be conducted through gift cards or bitcoin. \n\nCould you please provide an alternative method of payment? Preferably a bank transfer or a secure online payment platform.\n\nThank you for your understanding.\n\nBest regards,\nLewis D.\n\nBest wishes,\nShemika"
