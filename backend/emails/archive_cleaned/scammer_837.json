It's quite surprising to hear about my cousin Dare, as I don't recall giving him any such instructions. Could you please provide more details about the letters that were sent to me? I'm afraid I haven't received any.\n\nAlso, could you elaborate on the part payment fund you mentioned? How was it determined that this fund is in my favor?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nMark"
