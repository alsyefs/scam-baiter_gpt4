I am\nMarkus George Sr, head of luggage/baggage storage facilities here at the\nBellingham International Airport Ferndale Washington during my search for\nundelivered parcels I discovered an abandoned shipment from a Diplomat\nfrom Nairobi, Kenya and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum of\nmoney in a metal trunk box. The consignment was abandoned because the\nContents of the consignment was not properly declared by the consignee as\n“MONEY” rather it was declared as personal effect to avoid interrogation\nand also the inability of the diplomat to pay for the United States Non\nInspection Charges which is $3,800USD. On my assumption the consignment is\nstill left in our Storage House here at the Bellingham International\nAirport Ferndale Washington till date. The details of the consignment\nincluding your name, your email address and the official documents from\nthe United Nations office in Geneva are tagged on the Trunk box.\nHowever, \nto enable me confirm if you are the actual recipient of this\nconsignment as the assistant director of the Inspection Unit, I will\nadvise you provide your full information as Below:\nFULL NAME:\nADDRESS:\nPHONE NUMBER:\nOCCUPATION:\nCOUNTRY:\nWhat'sapp Number\nNEAREST AIRPORT:\nTo enable me to cross check if it corresponds with the address on the\nofficial documents including the name of the nearest Airport around your\ncity. \nPlease note that this consignment is supposed to have been returned\nto the  United States Treasury Department as unclaimed delivery due to the\ndelays in concluding the clearance processes so as a result of this,\n I\nwill not be able to receive your details on my official email account\n. So\nin order words to enable me to cross check your details, I will advise you\nto send the required details to my private email address for quick\nprocessing and response. Once I confirm you as the actual recipient of the\ntrunk box, I can get everything concluded within 48hours upon your\nacceptance and proceed to your address for delivery.\nLastly, be informed that the reason I have taken it upon myself to contact\nyou personally about this abandoned consignment is because I want us to\ntransact this business and share the money 70% for you and 30% for me\nsince the consignment has not yet been returned to the United States\nTreasury Department after being abandoned by the diplomat so immediately\nthe confirmation is made, I will go ahead and pay for the United States\nNon Inspection Fee of $3,800 dollars and arrange for the box to be\ndelivered to your doorstep Or I can bring it by myself to avoid any more\ntrouble but you have to assure me of my 30% share.\nI wait to hear from you urgently if you are stills alive and I will\nappreciate it if we can keep this deal confidential.\nThank you.\nMarkus George Sr.\nEmail:(\nMarkusGeorgeSr@asia.com\n)\nAssistant Inspection Director\nBellingham International Airport\nBellingham, WA 98226, United States."

Your message is quite intriguing, and I must say it's not every day that one receives such an interesting email. \n\nYou mentioned a parcel from Nairobi, Kenya. That's fascinating! I've always wanted to visit Africa. Have you ever been there? And how did this parcel end up in Bellingham Airport Ferndale Washington of all places?\n\nAlso, you mentioned something about a metal trunk box with money inside. How much money are we talking about here? It must be quite a sum if it was worth shipping all the way from Kenya.\n\nI'm curious about the United Nations office in Geneva being involved as well. What role do they play in this? And why would my name and email address be tagged on the Trunk box?\n\nLastly, you mentioned sharing the money between us. That sounds like a generous offer! But I wonder, what percentage were you thinking of for each of us?\n\nLooking forward to hearing more about this exciting opportunity!\n\nBest wishes,\nPhillip"
