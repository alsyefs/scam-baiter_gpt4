However, I must inform you that I have not yet received any such funds in my account.\n\nCould you please provide me with a transaction reference number or any other details that could help me track this transfer? Also, it would be helpful if you could provide more information about the source of these funds and why they are being transferred to me.\n\nAs for the personal information you requested, I am uncomfortable providing such details over email without knowing more about this situation. Could you please explain why you need this information?\n\nLooking forward to your prompt response.\n\nBest wishes,\nNellie"
