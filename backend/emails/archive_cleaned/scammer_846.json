It's not every day that one receives such an intriguing proposition.\n\nHowever, I do have a few questions if you don't mind me asking. Firstly, could you please provide more details about the client who shares my last name? It's quite a surprise to hear that I might be related to someone who had such a significant amount of money in the bank.\n\nSecondly, how did you manage to find me? My surname is quite common, so I'm curious as to how you were able to pinpoint me specifically as the next of kin.\n\nLastly, what would be the process for claiming this fund? Is there any paperwork involved?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nPaul"
