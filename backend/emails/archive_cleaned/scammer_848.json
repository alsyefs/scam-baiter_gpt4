        "body": "Urgent and Confidential Business Proposal\nI am Maung Lwin, account supervisor of Sibin Tharyar Yay Bank Ltd in\nMyanmar. and for reasons which will become obvious to you as read you\non, I obtained your address particulars from an Internet address\nlisting. Please exercise some patience and read through my message.\nTHIS IS NOT A SPAM MAIL!\nI have very urgent and confidential business proposition for you. On\n26th May, 2019 an Oil Consultant/Contractor with the Myanmar\nNational Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Ahmed Youseff Mustafa, a national\nof Iraq, made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for 12 calendar months,\nvalue USD10,000,000.00 in my branch.\nOn maturity, we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address\nbut got no reply. After a month,we sent a reminder and finally, his\ncontract employers, the Myanmar National Petroleum Corporation (MYNPC)\nwrote to inform us that Mr. A Y Mustafa died from an automobile\ncrash; that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace\nhis next of kin through the Iraqi embassy were fruitless. At first I\nwas surprised that I did not receive much official cooperation in my\ninquiries in order to trace his next of kin in Iraq, and inform them\nabout Mr. Mustafa's deposit of USD10m plus accrued interest.\nI therefore made further investigations and discovered that Mr.\nMustafa had actively opposed the Government of President Saddam\nHussein of Iraq, and was consequently driven into exile. Being an Oil\nExpert,he subsequently obtained a job with the MYNPC, and settled in\nMYANMAR. Thereafter, he walked into my Office to make the\naforementioned deposit of USD10m. He did not declare any kin in his\napplication paperwork, contrary to laid down procedures, and when I\nasked him he informed me that he wished it so. I accepted his\napplication because banks are conservative and will always honour a\ncustomer wishes, especially high networth customers.\nNo one knows the source of his money because apparently the time frame\nof his employment with the MYNPC does indeed preclude such a large\namount of money. It can be assumed that he brought his money over from\nIraq, but that is open to speculation.\nHowever, the point is that his employers are not aware of this money\nand therefore it can be safely assumed that no one will ever come\nforward to claim this money. This money total USD10m ( inclusive of\naccrued interests) is still sitting in my Bank in the Dormant Account\nPortfolio. No one will ever come forward to claim it now, and\naccording to MYANMAR law, after 3 years, the money will automatically\nrevert to the Government Treasury if the Account owner is a foreigner,\nis certified dead , and there is no valid claim. This indeed, is the\nsituation.\nMy proposal therefore is that \nI am looking for a foreigner who will\nstand in as the next of kin to Mr. Mustafa. It is not necessary to be\na blood relation to Mr.mustafa, nor have the same name. It is not also\nnecessary to come from the same Country. \nI have worked out the\nmodalities to achieve my aim of appointing a next of kin, and\ntherefore also by this means transfer this money total USD10m abroad\nfor us to share.\nThe method of achieving the objective of transferring this money\nabroad is a completely legal and proper way and it is simple. I intend\nto use an Attorney (representing you as BENEFICIARY) to execute a\nseries of affidavits in support of your claim. These will be approved.\nThe money transfer paperwork itself will include a certificate of\norigin so that the receiving bank does not ask questions or refuse the\nmoney as money laundering. Also, the paperwork will include proper\ncertification that the funds being transferred are from non criminal\nsources. In short this wil be a proper and legal money transfer and\nthere is no risk! I will have to process the initial paperwork to\nobtain approval from the Probate Registry ( Ministry of Justice ) to\nobtain the Letter of Administration empowering you as Sole\ntrustee/executor to the Estate of Mr.mustafa.\nIf you therefore agree to be the official Beneficiary, then please\nnote that you will not be required to sign any Money Transfer\nDocuments ( my Attorney will do all (that), you will not be required\nto come to MYANMAR.\nOnly the following is required from you:\n(1)Your full names\n(2) Your address, phone and fax numbers.\nOnce you send me the requested information as stated above, I will\ninitiate the processing of the transfer and in about 3 working days\nthe money total USD10m will be in your nominated bank account for us\nto share.\nThe ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you.\nThis transaction is guaranteed to succeed without any problems. If you\nagree to assist me by sending me the above requested information, do\nwrite me.\nLooking forward to your urgent reply.\nYours truly,\nMr. Maung Lwin"

        "body": "Hello Mr. Maung Lwin,\n\nThank you for reaching out and sharing this intriguing story with me. I must say, it's quite a tale! The life of Mr. Mustafa sounds like it was filled with adventure and mystery.\n\nI'm curious about a few things though. How did you manage to find my contact information? And why have you chosen me specifically for this task? \n\nAlso, could you please elaborate more on the process of transferring the money? You mentioned that it is completely legal and proper, but I would like to understand more about how it works.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nElla"
