        "body": "Hello Mr. Ahote Stephen,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me and providing such detailed information about the funds. It's quite a surprise to hear about this, as I wasn't expecting any funds from the US Government.\n\nBefore we proceed, could you please clarify a few things for me? How did my name come up in connection with these funds? And why were they held in custody by the US Government?\n\nI'm also curious about the three options you've mentioned for receiving the funds. Could you provide more details on how each of them works? For instance, if I choose online banking, how secure would my account be? \n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nJames"
