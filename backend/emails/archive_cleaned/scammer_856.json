        "body": "Hello Honorable Michael R. Pompeo,\n\nThank you for your detailed message. It's quite surprising to hear about this situation, I had no idea that I was involved in such a matter. \n\nI'm glad to know that the government is taking steps to rectify this issue and help victims like me. The amount mentioned is indeed substantial and would be of great help.\n\nCould you please provide more information on how this scam occurred? How did these impostors get my details? And how can I ensure that this doesn't happen again in the future?\n\nAlso, could you elaborate on the process of claiming the cash check? What does it mean when you say the check might expire?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nKevin"
