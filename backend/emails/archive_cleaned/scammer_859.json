Your proposal sounds interesting, but I have a few questions before we proceed further.\n\nFirstly, could you please explain more about the source of this money? You mentioned it was taken by some old politician - is this legal?\n\nSecondly, how exactly does the process work? How will the account details be changed to mine and how will the Visa card be sent to me?\n\nLastly, what percentage of the money would I be expected to send back to you?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nLarry"
