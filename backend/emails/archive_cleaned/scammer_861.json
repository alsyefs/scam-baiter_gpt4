        "body": "Dear Temper Williams,\n\nThank you for your email. I am excited about the prospect of receiving such a large sum of money. However, I have some concerns that I hope you can address.\n\nFirstly, it is unusual for a bank to ask for fees upfront before transferring funds. Usually, any fees associated with a transfer are deducted from the amount being transferred. Could you please explain why this is not the case in this instance?\n\nSecondly, could you provide more information about this clearance fee? What exactly does it cover and why is it necessary?\n\nLastly, could you provide some form of official documentation or proof that these funds exist and are legally mine? This would greatly help to alleviate my concerns.\n\nI look forward to your prompt response.\n\nBest wishes,\nJim"
