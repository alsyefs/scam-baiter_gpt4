He deposited $7million in a bitcoin wallet for me as my inheritance. The company invited me here regarding the funds deposited in my name, but I was told that they will not be able to release the funds to me because  I'm too young to handle such money. so I was told by Mr Peter Smith, CEO of the Company, to look for a beneficiary who will help me receive the funds.\n Sir, I sent you the deposit receipt in my name as next of kin, Please im waiting for recepose to help me and you will not spend money on the process to receive my funds but you will sign a contract agreement after you receive my funds. You will help me.\n \nBest Regards,\nMeeder   "

It must be tough being in such a predicament at a young age. \n\nI'm curious, how did you come across my contact information? Also, could you please provide more details about this process? What exactly would my role be in helping you receive these funds?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nAlan"
