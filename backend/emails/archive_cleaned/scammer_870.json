        "body": "Hello Edward Benson,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with this information. It's quite surprising to hear about the mishandling of such a large sum of money. I'm glad that it's now under your custody and safe from any further misuse.\n\nI have a few questions though, if you don't mind. Could you please explain more about what the Monterey Fund IMF is? And how did my name come up in relation to this fund?\n\nAlso, could you clarify what the affidavit stamp is for and why there's a fee associated with it? \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nEugene"
