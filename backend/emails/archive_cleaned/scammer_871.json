        "body": "***My Dear Good Friend***\nThanks for acknowledging my email. Let me formally introduce myself to you. I am Mr. Mhzita Frank, Executive and Head of Account department, (BOA) Bank of America, United Kingdom. I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail. I contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication.\nI contacted you regarding an abandoned sum of Â£3,100,000.00 Great British Pounds Sterling. In February 2013, a customer named Mr. Mohan Kumar Vivekanand from India came to our bank for business discussions and investment. As the officer in charge of his transaction; I encouraged him to consider various growths of funds with prime ratings. Then he invested Three Million One Hundred Thousand Great British Pounds Sterling only. Based on my advice, we were able to spin the initial deposit and made it a fixed deposit type of transaction.\nAfter a few months; my bank (BOA) sent several notices to him, and a notification was sent to him but still no response came from him. After a series of investigations, I got information that Mr. Mohan Kumar Vivekanand and his family were involved in a motor accident in which all his family members died, he sustained high degree injuries and was rushed to the hospital and also died of 'cardiac arrest' after learning that his family had all gone. Due to the sensitive nature of private Banking, most customers don't nominate next of kin in their investment, also usually in most cases leave their WILLS in our care, in this case; our now deceased client died without a possible traceable representative or legal heir.\nIt is quite clear now that our dear client died with no known or identifiable family member. According to practice, the Private Banking sector will by the end of this year broadcast a request for statement of claim to Bank of America United Kingdom, If  failure to receive viable claims they will probably retrieve the deposit from the Management of (BOA) Ltd. This will result in the money entering or being diverted into the British accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of the private Banking division. What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration of ten { 10 } years the funds will revert to the ownership of the UK Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.\nNow, I am prepared to give the necessary details to you as the closest surviving relation of our deceased customer (late Mr. Mohan Kumar Vivekanand). I am also proposing that after a successful execution of the business deal, the funds will be shared in the ratio of 60/40. You will get 40% and I will be entitled to 60% as the initiator of the deal. You know that I must have done my homework already before contacting you. Although the project is capital intensive, I know I will be able to pull it through following proper Banking and legal channels with your assistance at your end.\nI will tidy up the legal aspect with the assistance of a lawyer who will prepare all the documents that will be needed in order to transfer the money from the UK to your country. Once more, I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail and forget that I ever contacted you, I implore that you should be amenable, cooperative and eschew every skepticism. I have been utterly in this career for over 21 years now and I won't engage in any activity that could hurt you and I am expecting the same from you as brother.\nOpportunities like this only come once in a lifetime. I am a family man and this is an opportunity for me to give my family one of the best in life. I would like you to think about this and let me know your decision. If you give me a positive response; I will give you the relevant information for the successful transfer of these funds and we both must enjoy it in peace. I await your Response.\n \nRegards\nMr. Mhzita Frank,\nExecutive & Head of Account department,\nBank of America (BOA) , United Kingdom"

        "body": "Hello Mr. Mhzita Frank,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. I must say, your email has certainly piqued my interest! It's not every day that one receives such an intriguing proposition.\n\nThe story of Mr. Mohan Kumar Vivekanand is indeed a tragic one. It's always sad to hear about such unfortunate incidents. \n\nYou mentioned that the funds will be shared in a certain ratio, but I didn't quite catch the specifics. Could you please clarify what percentage of the funds would be allocated to me and what percentage would go to you?\n\nAlso, could you provide more details about the legal process? I'm not very familiar with these matters and would appreciate some additional information.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nJohn"
