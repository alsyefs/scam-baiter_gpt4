It must be a difficult time for his family and friends. \n\nI'm curious, how did the Director General of the Cash Delivery Payment Department of Central Bank of Nigeria find out about me? And why was I chosen to claim these funds?\n\nLooking forward to hearing more about this.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nDanny"
