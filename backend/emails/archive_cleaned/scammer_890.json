Rest assured, I am very much alive and well.\n\nI don't recall knowing a Dr. James Bake or Sanusi Lamido Sanusi. Could you tell me more about them? How did they come to know about me?\n\nAs for the bank details you mentioned, they don't seem familiar to me at all. Can you provide more information on this matter? \n\nI'm sorry but I can't provide any personal data like my cell number or photo due to privacy concerns. However, I'm more than willing to answer any questions that could help confirm my identity.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nHoward"
