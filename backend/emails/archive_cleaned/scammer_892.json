She was indeed a kind-hearted woman and her intentions were always for the betterment of others.\n\nHowever, I must clarify that I have not received any prior communication from Mrs. Ann regarding this donation fund. This is the first time I am hearing about it.\n\nCould you please provide more details about this donation fund? How can I access it and what are the legal procedures involved?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nJack"
