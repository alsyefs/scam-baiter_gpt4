        "body": "Hello Sambo Dasuki,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, this is quite a surprise! I wasn't aware that I had unclaimed funds in Nigeria. Could you please tell me more about how this situation came to be? \n\nAlso, could you provide some more details about the Foreign Debt Committee and its role? It sounds like an important task you've been given by President Bola Ahmed Tinubu.\n\nI'm curious as well about the process of releasing these funds. How does it usually work? And why are there unclaimed funds in the first place?\n\nLooking forward to your response!\n\nBest wishes,\nGordon"
