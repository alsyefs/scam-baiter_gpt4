        "body": "Dear Mr. Martin I. Cole,\n\nThank you for your email and the information provided. However, I would like to clarify a few things before proceeding further.\n\n1) Could you please provide more details about the \"Release Permit\" that you mentioned? What exactly is it and why is it necessary?\n\n2) You mentioned a control number available on my name but didn't provide any specific number. Could you please share that with me?\n\n3) You also mentioned a fee of USD but didn't specify the exact amount. How much is this fee?\n\n4) Lastly, could you please explain why I need to send this fee through steam wallet card or card? Is there any other method of payment available?\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nBrandon"
