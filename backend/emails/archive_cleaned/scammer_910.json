        "body": "   Hello my dear,\nHow are you doing today? It's my pleasure contacting you again, and please read this email carefully.  Having received my late father's fund with the help of my husband, both of us agreed to invest the money in a lucrative business of his choice which we did But right now his selfish desire won't let him do anything for me, he controls all my activities and  has failed to do any single thing of which we agreed upon rather \"he wants me to end up a housewife\" and I am so disappointed that he came to me just for the money.\nThe point is that I have filed for a divorce and the court has frozen all our assets until the case is over. Like I knew this would happen, before the transfer of my late father's fund, I withdrew the sum of ( $1.500,000 Us Dollars ) from my late father's account without his consent and deposited it in a fixed account with the help of my Agent, Mr. Richard Anderson. For the time being this is the only thing I can lay hands on until my divorce case is ruled. Our movements are restricted and our activities are being monitored so I would need your help to secure this fund for me.\nBefore writing this email to you, I spoke with my agent and I explained the situation of things to him, I would like to relocate to your country for some personal reasons once the case is over and I would like you to help me receive the money from my Agent and purchase an apartment for me in your area and save the rest of the money until my arrival to your country... Let me know if you can assist me on this and I will assure you that you will be rewarded handsomely once I come down to your country. If you are ready to help me on this I will contact my agent and then update you on the next step. Thank you\nBest wishes\nMs Monica Bill   "
