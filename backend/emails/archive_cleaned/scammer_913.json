        "body": "Hello Mrs. Chinyere Morgan,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, this is quite a surprise! I wasn't aware of any sum being credited to my name. Could you please provide more details about this? How did this come about and what exactly does it entail?\n\nAlso, regarding the person named Bordoy who claims to have power of attorney over my supposed claims, I don't recall giving anyone such authority. Could you tell me more about her? How did she get involved in this matter?\n\nI'm looking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nKim"
