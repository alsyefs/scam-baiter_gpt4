        "body": "Hello Mr. Antonio Guterres,\n\nThank you for your detailed message. It's quite a surprise to hear from someone from the United Nations! I must say, it's all a bit overwhelming.\n\nI'm curious about this ATM card you mentioned. How does it work exactly? And why is my fund in an ATM card instead of being transferred directly to my bank account?\n\nAlso, could you please explain more about the delivery fee? Why can't it be deducted from the total fund? \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nJames"
