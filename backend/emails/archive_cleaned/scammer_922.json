I'm really excited to proceed with this, but I have a few questions before we move forward. \n\nFirstly, could you please explain why the bank transfer copy is so important? I'm not very familiar with these processes and would appreciate some clarification.\n\nSecondly, could you provide more details about what exactly the payment is for? It's always good to know what I'm getting into.\n\nLastly, are there any other steps or requirements that I should be aware of?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nKaren"
