        "body": "Hello Beneficiary,\nThis letter is written to you in order to change your life from today.\nI am Mr Charles Moor, the new Managing Director/CEO, of this\nBank.Former Managing Director/CEO is now removed and all power has\nbeen vested on me to make all international and local\npayment.Furthermore due to allegations of corrupt practices against\nother U.S Bank, the Government of United State has appointed this Apex\nBank to effect all foreign overdue payment.Be informed that the\nGovernment have Approved the release of $68M which has been in this\nBank for many years UNCLAIMED. Mr. Peter Harry in collaboration with\nthe Chairman of Reserve Bank of USA have refuse to tell you the truth\non how to claim your fund.This is because they have been using the\ninterest accumulated from your fund every year to enrich themselves\nwithout your knowledge. I want to help you PULL OUT this fund to your\nBank account using the easiest and quickest method which has not been\nknown to you before. By this method of KEY TESTED TRANSFER (K.T.T)\nSYSTEM THROUGH AUTOMATED WIRE TRANSFER SYSTEM.\nA KEY TESTED TRANSFER (K.T.T) SYSTEM THROUGH AUTOMATED WIRE TRANSFER\nSYSTEM is a secure transfer which ALLOWS BENEFICIARY,S DIRECT ACCESS\nTO MAKE WITHDRAWAL OF FUND FROM HIS OR HER BANK AFTER 24 HOURS OF\nTRANSFER.\nThe essence of this (K.T.T) SYSTEM is to secure and protect your\npayment from being diverted by fraudulent people or making payment to\na foreign account which do not belong to you.The greatest advantage is\nthat you can instruct us to credit your nominated account bit by bit\nwith small amount thereby saving yourself from the trouble of\nFinancial Authority in your country who monitor large transfer due to\ncurrent trend of terrorism. Another beauty of the (K.T.T) SYSTEM is\nthat you can retain the balance left in your account in our Bank and\ncan also instruct us to pay out money to any Bank of your choice in\nthe world,or issue you an ATM Card which you can use in any part of\nthe world when on a business trip. I hope you now understand the\nadvantages of a (K.T.T) SYSTEM and why you need this account to\nreceive your payment of $68M now in our Bank....You are advice to\nforward as a matter of urgency your full information, direct telephone\nand Fax number and your contact address as we have started the process\nof the account for you. Call me on so that I will issue you a payment\nrelease code which must be given to you personally on telephone\nstrictly for security reason. This code is very important and it is\nwhat you will use to confirm your funds online.please reply me through\nmy alternative email  (\nmrcharlesmoor@aol.com\n)for security reasons.\nBest Regards\nMr Charles Moor,\nCentral Bank of the Midwest"
