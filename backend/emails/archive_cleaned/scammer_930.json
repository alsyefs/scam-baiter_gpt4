        "body": "  I am Garry Ellis.Head of Inspection Unit United Nations Inspection\nAgency. in Harts-field Jackson International Airport Atlanta, Georgia.\nDuring our investigating, We discovered An abandoned shipment through\na Diplomat from the United kingdom which was transferred from JF\nKennedy Airport. To our facility here in Atlanta, and when scanned it\nrevealed an undisclosed sum of money in 2 Metal Trunk Boxes weighing\napproximately 110kg each. The consignment was abandoned because the\ncontent was to properly declared by the consignee as money rather it\nwas declared as a personal Effect/classified document to either avoid\ndiversion by the shipping Agent or confiscation by the relevant\nauthorities.\nThe diplomat's inability to pay for Non Inspection fees among other\nthings are the reason why the consignment is delayed and abandoned. By\nmy assessment, each of the boxes contains about $4M or more. they are\nstill left in the airport storage facility till today. the\nconsignments like I said are tow metal trunk boxes weighing about\n110kg each (Internal dimension: W61 x H156 x D73 (cm) effective\ncapacity: 680 L) Approximately. The details of the consignment\nincluding your name and email on the official document from the United\nNations' office in London where the shipment was tagged as personal\neffects/classified document is still available with us.\n1. Full Name:-----------------------------------------------\n2. Address:-----------------------------------------------------\n3. Nationality:-----------------------------------------------\n4. Age: Date of Birth:-----------------------------------------------\n5. Occupation :--------------------------------------------------\n6. Phone: Mobile:---------------------------------------------\n7. State of Origin:---------------------------------------------------\nso I can cross check and see if it correspond with the one on the\nofficial documents.\nIt is now left to you to decide if you still need the consignment or\nallow us to repatriate it back to the UK (place of origin) as we were\ninstructed. like I did say again, the shipper abandoned it and ran\naway most importantly because he give a false declaration, he could\nnot pay for the yellow tag, he could not secure a valid non inspection\ndocument(s), etc. I am ready to assist you in any way i can for you to\nget back this package provided you will also give me something out of\nit (financial gratification). You can either come in person, or you\nengage the services of a secure shipping/delivery company/agent that\nwill provide the necessary security. That is required to deliver the\npackage to your doorstep or the destination of your choice. I need all\nthe guarantees that I can get from you before I can get involved in\nthis project. please Reply this email strictly at\n(\nmrgarryellis68@gmail.com\n) with reconfirmation of your full Name,\nHome Address, City, State and Telephone number.\nI wait to hear from you very urgently.\nSincerely,\nMr.Garry Ellis.\nHead Officer-in-Charge\nAdministrative Service Inspection Unit.

        "body": "Hello Ellis,\n\nThank you for reaching out and sharing this intriguing information. It's quite a surprise to hear about these abandoned metal trunk boxes. I'm curious, how often do such incidents occur at your facility? \n\nI understand that the boxes contain a significant sum of money. However, I'm wondering why the original consignee would abandon such a valuable shipment? It seems rather unusual, don't you think?\n\nAlso, could you please explain more about the Non Inspection fees and other costs that led to this situation? How much are these fees typically?\n\nLastly, I'd like to know more about the process of repatriating the shipment back to its place of origin in the UK. What does it involve and how long does it usually take?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nBrian"
