Can you tell me more about how I came to have this overdue payment of million USD dollars? \n\nAlso, could you explain a bit more about the process? How does it work with the ATM card or bank wired transfer or online account opening?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nWilliam"
