        "body": "Hello Mr. Kenny,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me and providing such detailed information about the two trunk boxes. I must say, this is quite a surprise! \n\nI'm curious, how did these boxes end up at John Glenn Columbus Airport? And why are they associated with my name? It's fascinating that such a large amount of cash was found in them.\n\nAs for picking up the boxes, I'm afraid it might be a bit difficult for me to travel all the way to Ohio at the moment. You mentioned the possibility of using a registered reliable courier delivery company - could you recommend any?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nBest wishes,\nHoward"
