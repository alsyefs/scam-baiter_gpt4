        "body": "Dear Mr. Koskinen,\n\nI am quite surprised to receive your email regarding a box containing USD Two Billion United States Dollars. I must admit, this is the first time I've heard of such a thing.\n\nRegarding the woman you mentioned, I can assure you that I have no sister and certainly did not authorize anyone to claim any funds on my behalf. It seems there may be some misunderstanding or perhaps even fraudulent activity at play here.\n\nBefore proceeding further, could you please provide more details about this situation? Specifically, how did my name come to be associated with this box and the lottery sponsored by Coca Cola Company?\n\nI look forward to your prompt response.\n\nBest wishes,\nKathy"
