        "body": "Hello there,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, this is quite an interesting proposition. However, I have a few questions that I'd like to clarify before proceeding further.\n\nFirstly, could you please provide more details about the payment that was left in your custody? How did it end up there and why was I not informed earlier?\n\nSecondly, could you explain why the payment method is specifically through Google Play CARD or Steam Wallet? Is there any particular reason for this choice of transaction?\n\nLastly, could you elaborate on what exactly the Special BONUS offer entails? It sounds intriguing but I would like to understand it better.\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nChristopher"
