        "body": "Hello Mr. William Ben,\n\nWow, that's quite a story! I can assure you that I am very much alive and well, thank you for asking. It's strange to hear about this Mr. Mark Donald Jackson claiming otherwise. \n\nI'm curious though, how did he manage to convince the federal government authority of such a thing? And why would he claim that I died of throat cancer? That's oddly specific.\n\nAlso, could you please explain more about this fund of Million US Dollars? How did it come into my name in the first place?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon!\n\nP.S: Just a friendly reminder, I won't be able to share any personal information online for security reasons. Hope you understand!\n\nBest wishes,\nJohn"
