However, I would like to clarify a few things before proceeding.\n\n1. Could you please specify the exact amount in Pounds that I need to send?\n2. You mentioned using World Remit Online Transfer, but the link seems to be missing from your email. Could you please provide me with the correct link?\n3. After making the payment, do I just send you an email with proof of payment attached?\n\nI look forward to your response so we can proceed with this matter.\n\nBest wishes,\nAndrew"
