However, I must admit that I am a bit confused as I do not recall any previous communication about this matter.\n\nBefore we proceed, could you please provide more details about the accident and how my name was associated with these funds? Also, it would be helpful if you could explain more about the investment made in my name.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nRick"
