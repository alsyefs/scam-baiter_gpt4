It's truly inspiring to see such generosity, especially in difficult times like these.\n\nHowever, I must admit that I'm a bit confused about some details of this Dream Project you mentioned. Could you please elaborate more on what exactly this project is about? What kind of help do the less privileged need and how can this donation be used to provide it?\n\nAlso, could you tell me more about how you found out about my love for humanity? I'm just curious because I don't remember sharing such information publicly.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nTravis"
