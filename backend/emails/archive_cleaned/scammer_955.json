        "body": "Dear Beloved Calvin,\r\n\r\nI am happy to receive your response and May the good Lord almighty bless\r\nyou beyond your human comprehension. I am Mrs. Isabella Mario and I am a\r\nSpanish woman and I live here in Spain and I am currently hospitalized for\r\nbreast cancer illness. I understand that you know that millions of children\r\naround the world have been deprived of the warm, tender touch of a loving\r\nmother and the serene care of a father. In the younger innocent and playful\r\nstage, these children were forced to mature quickly pushing adulthood for\r\nsurvival because there was no parental guidance, and in many cases, they\r\ntook care of their younger siblings. My plan is to see that this money is\r\nused for charity, to help orphans, widows, and the less fortunate people in\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nHaving known my condition, I have decided to donate this fund to orphanages\r\nbecause I was touched by the afflictions of the less privileged to donate\r\nwhat I have inherited from my late husband to you for the good work of the\r\ncharity.\r\n\r\nCurrently, I am seriously sick and I do not want to abandon this money in\r\nthe bank vault and that is the reason I decided to donate this fund to you\r\nso that you will help me set up a charity organization where the needy will\r\nbenefit from life struggles. If you accept my proposal and indicate\r\ninterest in helping me build a charity organization with these funds, I\r\nwill officially and legally introduce you to the bank for the fund transfer\r\nand I'll also sign a power of attorney certificate in your name.\r\n\r\nI want you to send me the following information to enable me to sign a\r\npower of attorney certificate on your behalf to the bank for the fund\r\ntransfer to you;\r\n\r\n1) Your names\r\n2) Home or office\r\n3) Your direct phone number\r\n4) Nationality\r\n5) Occupation\r\n\r\nPlease send me your details as soon as you receive this message so that I\r\ncan sign the power of attorney on your behalf to allow the fund transfer to\r\nyour bank account.\r\n\r\nCurrently, this fund is still in the vault of the Bank and I need you to\r\nhelp me and act according to my desire and dreams in the development of a\r\ncharity organization. My purpose is to help relieve poverty by providing\r\nitems needed by the homeless or those on a low income.\r\n\r\nI expect to hear from you.\r\n\r\nYour sister\r\n\nMrs. Isabella Mario."
