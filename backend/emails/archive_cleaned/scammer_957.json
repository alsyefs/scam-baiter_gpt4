I'm quite surprised to hear about this situation, but I appreciate your efforts in resolving it.\n\nI understand that there's a sum of money that has been sent this morning and there's more to come until September. That sounds like a lot of money! Could you please clarify how much exactly is the total amount?\n\nAlso, you mentioned something about a Clean Bill Record. What does that mean? Is it some kind of document or certificate?\n\nI'm sorry for all the questions, but as you can imagine, this is all very new and unexpected for me.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nPamela"
