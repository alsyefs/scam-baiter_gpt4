Could you please provide more details about how my name ended up there? \n\nAlso, could you explain a bit more about the process of releasing these funds? I'm not very familiar with these procedures and would appreciate some clarification.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nRobert"
