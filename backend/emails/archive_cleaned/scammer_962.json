It's quite exciting to hear about this program organized by the European Union in collaboration with Standard Chartered Bank. \n\nCould you please tell me more about how I was selected for this funds scheme? And what is the purpose of this program? Is there any specific project or cause that these funds are meant to support?\n\nI appreciate your guidance on contacting Mr. at Standard Chartered Bank. However, before I proceed, could you provide some more details about him? Like his full name or position at the bank? This would help me feel more confident in reaching out.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nLaura"
