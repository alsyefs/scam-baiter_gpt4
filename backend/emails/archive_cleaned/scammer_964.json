It's very noble of you to think about charity in such difficult times.\n\nHowever, I must inform you that it would be inappropriate for me to accept such a responsibility without knowing more details about the nature of the charity work you have in mind. Could you please provide more information on how you would like these funds to be used for charitable purposes?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nCharles"

Absolutely, it is important to indicate the kind and nature of\r\ncharity work I desire, which mainly is to promote the gospel of our Lord\r\nJesus. Establishing churches and promoting the work of God.\r\n\r\nAlso helping the orphans and widows. Mainly donating to orphanage homes and\r\nhelping victims of war and natural disasters affected people globally.\r\n\r\nThis is the kind of charity work that pleases my heart. I will feel\r\nfulfilled to see this kind of charity implemented in good faith.\r\n\r\nSo this is my brief explanation, and now I would like you to forward your\r\ndetails for the process to commence and once again do have a lovely day and\r\nremain blessed.\r\n\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nYour sister,\r\n\r\nMrs. Mary Russell."
