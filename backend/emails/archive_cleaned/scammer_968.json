        "body": "Dear Friend,\nLet me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. SONG LI LE director of\noperations of the Hang Seng Bank Ltd.I have an obscured business\nsuggestion for you. Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Colonel\nSadiq Uday who was with the Iraqi forces and also businessman made a\nnumbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of\nNineteen millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in\nmy branch.\nUpon maturity several notices was sent to him, even during the war\nwhich began in 2003. Again after the war another notification was sent\nand still no response came from him. We later find out that the\nGeneral along with his wife and only daughter had been killed during\nthe war in a bomb blast that hit their home. You can read more about\nthe bombings on visiting these sites below:\nAfter further investigation it was also discovered that Colonel Sadiq\nUday did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including\nthe paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the\nlast time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his\ndeposit in my bank. So, Nineteen millions Five Hundred Thousand United\nState Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come\nforward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the\nlaws of my country at the expiration 5 years the funds will revert to\nthe ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim\nthe funds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will\nlike you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Colonel Sadiq\nUday so that you will be able to receive his funds.\nMODALITIES:\nI want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we\nshall come out successful. I have an attorney that will prepare the\nnecessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Colonel\nSadiq Uday, all that is required from you at this stage is for you to\nprovide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can\ncommence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the\nattorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the\nnecessary approval and of probate in your favour for the move of the\nfunds to an account that will be provided by you.\nThere is no risk\ninvolved at all in this matter\n, as we are going to adopt a legalized\nmethod and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents.\nPlease endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning\nthis issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated\nbank account we shall then share in the ratio of 70% for me, 30% for\nyou. \nShould you be interested please send me your,\nFull names,\nprivate phone number,\ncurrent residential address.\nAnd I will prefer you reach me on my private email address below:\n(\nmrsonglile03@gmail.com\n) and finally after that I shall provide you\nwith more details of this operation.Your earliest response to this\nletter will be appreciated.\nKind Regards,\nMr. Song Li le"
