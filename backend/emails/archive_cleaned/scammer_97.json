        "body": "Hello Mr. Peter Johnson,\n\nThank you for your message and the update on the situation. I'm glad to hear that the mistake has been corrected and that my ATM master card is now in Atlanta, USA.\n\nI have a few questions though, if you don't mind. Could you please explain what exactly is an airport passing fee? I've never heard of such a thing before. Also, why does it need to be paid in RAZER GOLD CARD OR STEAM WALLET GIFT CARD? Is there any other way to pay this fee?\n\nAlso, could you provide more details about this ATM master card? How was it approved by WORLD BANK and why was it loaded with United States Currency Dollars?\n\nI'm sorry for all these questions but I just want to make sure I understand everything correctly.\n\nLooking forward to your reply.\n\nBest wishes,\nLaura"
