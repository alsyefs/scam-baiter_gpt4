From all indication\nmy condition is really deteriorating, and my doctors have courageously\nadvised me that I may not live beyond 3 month; this is because the\ncancer has reached a critical stage.\nI was married to late Dr Enkhbold Altangerel, gold & diamond\nexportation) in Burkina Faso, West Africa, where we live all our Lives\nfor Thirty-two years before he died in the year2004. But is quite\nunfortunately, He died after a Cardiac Arteries Operation that lasted\nonly for four days.\nSince his death I decided not to re-marry, I deposited all the sum of\n$5.5million dollars with a Bank in Ouagadougou- Burkina Faso, where we\nspend our life together in Burkina Faso.\nPresently, this money is still in their custody, and the management\njust wrote me as the Legitimate beneficiary to come forward to receive\nthe money after keeping it for so long or rather issue a letter of\nauthorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf since I cannot\ncome over as a result of my illness, or they get it confiscated.\nE-mail: (\nmrszolzayaenkhbold@gmail.com\n)\nPresently, Iâ€™m with my laptop in a hospital where I have been\nundergoing treatment. I have since lost my ability to do anything\nmyself and my doctors have told me that I have only 3 month to live.\nNow that i am about to end the race like this, without any family\nmembers and no child. It is my last wish to see that this money is\ninvested, but you will assure me that you will take 50% of the money\nand give 50% to the orphanages home in your country for my heart to\nrest.\nI want your good humanitarian, to also use this money to fund\nchurches, orphanages and widows around. I must let you know that this\nwas a very hard decision, but I had to take a bold step towards this\nissue because I have no further option. I hope you will help see my\nlast wishes come true.\nAs soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the\nBank. I will also issue you a letter of authority which will prove\nthat you are the new beneficiary of my funds, and the documents\nconcerning the deposit. Please assure me that you will act accordingly\nas I stated herein. Hope to hear from you soonest. I am waiting your\nresponse.\nYours Sick Sister in Christ,\nMrs. Zolzaya Enkhbold."
