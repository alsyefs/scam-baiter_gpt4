Could you please provide more details about how my name ended up on the list of scam victims? \n\nAlso, could you explain a bit more about the three options for receiving funds? I'm not very familiar with these processes, so any additional information would be greatly appreciated.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nMartha"
