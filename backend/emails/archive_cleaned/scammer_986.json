It's quite a lot to take in, but I'm trying my best to understand it all. \n\nI see that you mentioned something about a payment schedule list and a new payment with some approval numbers. Could you please explain more about this? What does it mean exactly?\n\nAlso, you mentioned a code that I should look for in emails from Ms. Georgieva. How will this code be used? And what should I do if I receive an email without the code?\n\nLastly, you mentioned Mr Rod Anderson at the end of your message. Who is he and how is he related to this process?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nJorge"
