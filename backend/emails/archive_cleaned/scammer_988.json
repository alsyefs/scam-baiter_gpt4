I appreciate your trust in me, but I must admit, I'm not very experienced in managing large sums of money or investments.\n\nCould you please provide more details about the type of business venture you have in mind? Also, how did you come across my email address?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nBrenda"
