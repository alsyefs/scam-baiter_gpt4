My condition is getting worse\nday by day.\nI lost my husband on February 16 2018. Meanwhile I have been fighting\nfrom cancer I have had for a long time and my doctor said that now the\nstage of my disease is out of control and I have a few more months to\nlive.\nBefore my husband's death, he had a $2.8 million United State dollars\ncontract in Turkish, but his death took him before\nthe money was transferred to my bank account, while my husband was a\nphilanthropist before his death , He also encouraged me to help poor,\norphans and widows because since we got married, we couldn't have\nchildren until death separates us.\nNow Due to my state of health, I have sent One million dollars to my\nfamily back home ( Philippines) and have deposited $800,000. dollars to\nthe hospital for my treatment.\nI want to send the remaining One million dollars to you so that you\nwill help me give it to poor people and widows in your country, As\nordered by my late husband because we have no children to inherit this\nmoney, do not discriminate against religion, ethnicity when\ncontrolling this project.
