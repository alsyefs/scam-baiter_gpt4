It's hard to imagine being involved in such a big thing. \n\nBut I have to ask, how did you manage to track down all these people across different countries? That must have been a huge operation! And what will happen to them now? Will they be punished for their actions?\n\nAlso, this ATM Visa Card sounds very convenient. But how does it work exactly? Is it safe and secure? I mean, with all the digital thefts happening these days, one can never be too careful.\n\nAnd finally, could you tell me more about this Accountant in Charge of my payment? How do I know they are trustworthy?\n\nI'm sorry for all the questions. This is all so new and overwhelming for me!\n\nBest wishes,\nTisha"
