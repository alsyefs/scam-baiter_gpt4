I don’t really know how to\nstart; \nI’m actually from Ukraine who managed to escape through the\nevacuation process from Kherson, Ukraine\n.\nMy name is Daniela Aksamit, \nI am currently in Ireland as a refugee\nseeking for your assistance to enable me move to my dream destination.\nUnfortunately my father was killed during the invasion by Russia\nbefore I had an opportunity to escape the war alive. I am privileged\nto secure my late father’s fortune, which he disclosed where it was\nkept for safety purposes before his death.\nIt was his life savings and was kept as my inheritance before the\ninvasion of Ukraine, my country by Russia. \nI used the escaping\nopportunity to lift  the inheritance with the help of a South African\nRed Cross Society Organization official and deposited the Fortune with\na firm for safety purpose.\nI have been trying to get in touch with him for the past two months\nbut all to no avail. This is the reason why I am seeking for your\nassistance and consent to entrust the inheritance in your care so you\ncan help invest the fortune in any profitable business venture because\nI cannot do anything on my own from here and my country is on fire at\nthe moment but I am very lucky that the Red Cross Society Organization\nofficial provided me with the company's information before we lost\ncommunication.\nBased on your acceptance, I will send you the company's information to\nenable you communicate with them for official introduction as my late\nfather's foreign business partner so that the company will set\nmodalities on how it can be sent to you by airfreight after which we\nshall discuss on my personal meeting with you on the way forward\nregarding my stay and investment plans.\nThanks for your willingness.\nDaniela Aksamit\nKindly revert back to me via my personal email account: \nnewcinegs@gmail.com"

You mentioned your father's fortune and a company involved in its safekeeping. Could you tell me more about this company?
