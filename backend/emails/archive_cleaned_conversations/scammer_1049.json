However, I would like to clarify a few things before proceeding further.\n\nFirstly, could you please provide more details about the payment status that has arrived at your department? What does this entail and how does it affect me?\n\nSecondly, you mentioned a fee that needs to be paid. Could you please specify the amount of this fee and provide instructions on how to make the payment?\n\nLastly, could you please explain what the waiver of charges means in this context? Does it mean that once I pay the specified fee, there will be no additional costs or fees charged?\n\nI look forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nGreg"
