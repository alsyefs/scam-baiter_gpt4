But let me see if I understand correctly.\n\nSo, there's an ATM card with my name on it? That's quite surprising! And Mr. Bill Carlton is involved somehow? I don't think I know any Bill Carlton. Can you tell me more about him?\n\nAlso, you mentioned something about a new address in Ontario, Canada. I've never been to Canada before. Is that where the ATM card is right now?\n\nI'm sorry for all the questions but as you can see, this is all very new to me. Could you please explain everything in simpler terms?\n\nThank you so much for your patience!\n\nBest wishes,\nTommy"
