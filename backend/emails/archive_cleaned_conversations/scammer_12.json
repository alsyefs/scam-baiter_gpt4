        "body": "Thank you for your response.\r\n\r\nI am  Andrew Bailey   â€“ Formerly Chief Executive Officer In charge of\r\nFinancial Conduct Authority and international investment, now Governor\r\nBANK OF ENGLAND.\r\n\r\nPlease ignore the length of this message and take your time to read\r\nthis message for your understanding. This is very important.\r\n\r\nI am contacting you concerning a deceased customer and an investment\r\nhe placed under our bank's management. I would respectfully request\r\nthat you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the\r\nintegrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail.\r\n\r\nI contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is\r\ninformed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with\r\ncertain facts that I believe would be of interest to you.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, the subject matter: Engineer Sylvester Roelofse came to our\r\nbank to engage in business discussions with our private banking\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\nHe informed us that he had a financial portfolio of $4,000,000.00 USD\r\n(Four Million United State Dollars) which he wished to have us turn\r\nover (invest) on his behalf. I was the officer assigned to his case; I\r\nmade numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto chief\r\noperations officer of the private banking sector, especially given the\r\nvolume of funds he wished to put into our bank. We met on numerous\r\noccasions prior to any investments being placed.\r\n\r\nI encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings.\r\nI invested his funds into trading in Stock Market, Crude Oil and\r\nLending with Profit Returns, as my specialty is to advise customers to\r\ninvest healthy and yield good profit. Based on my advice, we spun the\r\nmoney across various opportunities and made attractive margins for our\r\nfirst months of operation, the accrued profit and interest stood out\r\nand my client was glad with the returns.\r\n\r\nIn mid-2010, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed\r\nto make an urgent landed property investment requiring cash payments\r\nin the Kingdom of Spain. He directed that I liquidate the funds and\r\ndeposit it with a security firm in a private Bank (Tesco Banking Plc). I\r\ninformed him that the Bank of England would have\r\nto make special arrangements to have this done and in order not to\r\ncircumvent due process, the bank would have to make a 9.5 % deduction\r\nfrom the funds to cater for banking and statutory charges. He\r\ncomplained about the charges but later came around when I explained to\r\nhim the complexities of the task he was asking of us. Cash movement\r\nacross borders has become especially strict since the incidents of\r\n9/11. I contacted my affiliate here in London and made the funds\r\navailable to the security firm.\r\n\r\nI undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise\r\ninstructions to the latter and had the funds deposited at the private\r\nBank, (Tesco Banking Plc) is a specialist private Bank\r\nthat accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip\r\ncorporations that handle valuable products or undertake transactions\r\nthat need immediate access to cash.\r\n\r\nThis small and highly private organization is familiar especially to\r\nthe highly placed and well-connected organizations. In line with\r\ninstructions, the money was deposited with Tesco Banking Plc. The deceased\r\ntold me he wanted the money there in\r\nanticipation of his arrival from South Africa later that week. This\r\nwas the last communication we had, this transpired around 25th October\r\n2010. In June last year, we got a call from Tesco Banking Plc informing us\r\nabout the activity of that particular portfolio.\r\n\r\nThis was an astounding position as far as I was concerned, given the\r\nfact that I managed the private banking sector I was the only one who\r\nknew about the deposit at Tesco Banking Plc, and I\r\ncould not understand why the deceased had not come forward to claim\r\nhis deposit. I made futile efforts to locate the deceased. I\r\nimmediately passed the task of locating him to the internal\r\ninvestigations department of Bristol & West. Four days later,\r\ninformation started to trickle in, apparently our client was dead. A\r\na person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack\r\nin Cannes, South of France.\r\n\r\nWe were soon enough able to identify the body and cause of death was\r\nconfirmed. The bank immediately launched an investigation into\r\npossible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also\r\nto come forward to claim his estate. If you are familiar with private\r\nbanking affairs, those who patronize our services usually prefer\r\nanonymity, but also some levels of detachment from conventional\r\nprocesses. In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin.\r\n\r\nIn the field of private banking, opening an account with us means no\r\none will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name;\r\ndepositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This\r\nbank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to\r\nthem or held at the bank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of\r\nthe account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of kin.\r\nPrivate banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also\r\nusually in most cases leave wills in our care, in this case; the\r\nThe deceased died without a testate.\r\n\r\nIn line with our internal processes for account holders who have\r\npassed away, we instituted our own investigations in good faith to\r\ndetermine who should have the right to claim the estate. This\r\ninvestigation has for the past months been unfruitful. We have scanned\r\nevery continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies\r\nto get to the root of the problem. It is this investigation that\r\nresulted in my being furnished with your details as a possible\r\nrelative of the deceased. My official capacity dictates that I am the\r\nonly party to supervise the investigation and the only party to\r\nreceive the results of the investigation. What this means, you being\r\nThe last batch of names we have considered, is that our dear late\r\nfellow died with no or identifiable family member. As this leaves me\r\nas the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing\r\nsituation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of\r\nthe deposit.\r\n\r\nAccording to practice, Tesco Banking Plc will by the\r\nend of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of claim\r\nto Bristol & West, failing to receive viable claims they will probably\r\nrevert the deposit back to Bristol & West. This will result in the\r\nmoney entering the Bristol & West accounting system and the portfolio\r\nwill be out of my hands and out of the private division of Tesco Banking Plc.\r\nThis will not happen if I have my way. What I\r\nwish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want you\r\nto understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world\r\nwho finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The\r\n world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for\r\nthose who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios.\r\n\r\nYou should have begun by now to put together the general direction of\r\nwhat I propose. I alone have the deposit details and they will release\r\nthe deposit to no one unless I instruct them to do so. I alone know of\r\nthe existence of this deposit for as far as Bristol & West is\r\nconcerned, the transaction with our late customer concluded when I\r\nsent the funds to Tesco Banking Plc, all outstanding\r\ninteractions in relation to the file are just customer services and\r\ndue process.\r\n\r\nTesco Banking Plc has no single idea of what, the\r\nhistory or nature of the deposit. They are simply awaiting\r\ninstructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward.\r\nThis is the situation. This bank has spent great amounts of money\r\ntrying to track this man? Family; they have investigated for months\r\nand have found no family. The investigation has come to an end. My\r\nproposal; you share similar details to the late fellow; I am prepared\r\nto place you in a position to instruct Tesco Banking Plc to release the\r\ndeposit to you as the closest surviving\r\nrelation.\r\n\r\nUpon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you\r\nin half. That is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin and\r\nhave them release the deposit to you. We share the proceeds 50/50.I\r\nwould have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me, but that\r\nwould have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming\r\nthe deposit. I assure you that I could have the deposit released to\r\nyou within a few days. I will simply inform the bank of the final\r\nclosing of the file relating to the deceased. I will then officially\r\ncommunicate with Tesco Banking Plc and instruct them to release the deposit\r\nto you. With these two things: all is done. The\r\nalternative would be for us to have Tesco Banking Plc\r\ndirect the funds to another bank with you as account holder.\r\n\r\nThis way there will be no need for you to think of traveling to lay\r\nclaim to the money from Tesco Banking Plc. We can\r\nfine-tune this based on our interactions. I am aware of the\r\nconsequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in\r\nthis project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not\r\nbe vindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you,\r\ndelete this message and forget I ever contacted you.\r\n\r\nDo not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal.\r\nYou may not know this but people like me who have made tidy sums out\r\nof comparable situations run the whole private banking sector. I am\r\nnot a criminal and what I do, I do not fight against good conscience,\r\nthis may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my\r\nindustry dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come\r\nonce in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by, for once I\r\nfind myself in total control of my destiny. These chances wonâ€™t pass\r\nme by. I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you will not work\r\nwith me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy\r\nme.\r\n\r\nI am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new\r\nopportunities. There is a reward for this project and it is a task\r\nwell worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I\r\nhave here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. I\r\nam the only one who knows of this situation, good fortune has blessed\r\nyou with a name that has planted you into the centre of relevance in\r\nmy life. Let's Share the blessing. If you find yourself able to work\r\nwith me, contact me through this same email account. If you give me\r\npositive signals, I will initiate this process towards a positive\r\nconclusion. I wish to inform you that you should contact me via\r\nofficial channels; I will deny knowing you and about this project.\r\n\r\nI repeat, I do not want you contacting me through my official phone\r\nlines nor do I want you contacting me through my official email\r\naccount. Contact me only through this email address for now. I do not\r\nwant any direct link between you and me to raise suspicion. My\r\nofficial lines are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored\r\nto assess our level of customer care in line with our Total Quality\r\nManagement Policy. (TQMP)\r\n\r\nPlease observe this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am\r\na family man; I have a wife and children. I send you this mail not\r\nwithout a measure of fear as to what the consequences are, but I know\r\nwithin me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and\r\nriches never come easy or on a platter of gold. This is the one truth\r\nI have learnt from my private banking yearsâ€™ experience. Do not betray\r\nmy confidence if we can be of one accord.\nBest Regards,\r\nAndrew Bailey\r\nBank of England."
