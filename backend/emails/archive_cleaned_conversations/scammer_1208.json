I can assure you that I am very much alive and well, thank goodness! \n\nAs for the car accident, there seems to be some misunderstanding. Could you please provide more details about this incident? And how did Mrs. Polinice come to believe that I was involved in such an unfortunate event?\n\nAlso, could you explain more about these funds that she is trying to claim on my behalf? It's all a bit confusing.\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nCarlos"
