It's not every day that one hears about someone trying to claim their funds under false pretenses.\n\nCould you please provide more details about this situation? How did it come to be that someone is attempting to claim my funds? And how were you able to discover this?\n\nAs for the information you requested, I'm afraid I can't provide them at the moment due to privacy concerns. However, I am eager to learn more about this situation and how we can resolve it together.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nArielle"
