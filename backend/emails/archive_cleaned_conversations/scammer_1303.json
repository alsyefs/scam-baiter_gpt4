Could you please provide more details about it? How did my name come up in connection with this fund?\n\nAlso, could you explain a bit more about how the ATM PLATINUM CARD works? It sounds like an interesting concept, but I'm not entirely sure I understand it.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nDale"
