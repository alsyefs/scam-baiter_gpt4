        "body": "  Central Bank of Nigeria,\nPlot 33, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa Way\nCentral Business District,\nCadastral Zone,\nAbuja, Federal Capital Territory,\nNigeria\nP.M.B. 0187,\nGarki Abuja.\nNigeria\n        WHY YOU HAVE NOT  SUCCEEDED IN RECEIVING YOUR FUND.\nAfter waiting to hear from you or your Nigeria partners for a long\ntime now. I decided to make this direct approach to you in order not\nto let it be as if I have anything in mind against you. I do not know\nif you have asked yourself why each time the release of this fund is\napproved, all of sudden, the payment will be stopped or one problem or\nthe other will come up. If you have not asked this question or you do\nnot know, this is an opportunity for me to tell you.\nSome time ago, your Nigerian friend I mean the people that introduced\nyou to the project approached me through my dear wife who works with\nthe Federal Ministry of Finance and requested me to assist them\nconclude a money transfer deal they had with you, they requested me to\nassist them by removing the original contractors name, company’s name\nand your bank particulars from Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Vetting\nand replacing them with your name and your bank details in order to\nmake you appear as the rightful beneficiary of this funds. I agreed on\nconditions that they would pay me US$100,000 as soon as your name\nappears as the beneficiary. I did as agreed and demanded to be paid\nbut your friends started telling me stories.\nThey even told me that you promised to send money to me, do you know\nthat up till now, I have not received a single cent from them and have\nnot set my eyes on any of them.This is why i decided to hear from you\nsince your name has been enlisted along with other beneficiaries to\nreceive their funds.\nBut  based on their attitude, I decided to stop the funds release\nmovement because I cannot be denied my right in my own office\nconsidering the risk as it might affect my job. Secondly, I know the\nsource of the funds that you did not execute any contract in Nigeria,\nalthough I am the only person privileged to know this information and\nit is a fact. Why I am making this clear to you is that I can see that\nyou are still making efforts in order to conclude this project.\nNow I am ready to forget the past. I do not need the US$100,000 any\nlonger from you but a good compensation from your mind. I need your\nassurance that your colleagues will be totally kept out of this\ntransaction. I know that none of them are aware of my new approach to\nyou. Stop spending your money unnecessarily on CBN Officers both here\nand overseas because you will not receive this money without my hand\nin it. I personally did the work at the beginning and only I can\nperform it. The secret is that your partners failed to stamp duty on\nyour contract documents and it is the true fact.\nFinally, I need your promise that no official of the Central Bank of\nNigeria will be aware of my involvement in this regard because of my\nposition. Now re-assure that you will be willing to compensate me.\nThat you will assist my wife to establish a foreign account in your\ncountry where my compensation will be lodged. Also a KTT FUND RELEASE\nAPPROVALS DOCUMENTS will be sent to you for endorsement after which I\nwill remit the money within 48 hours. I am a man of my words, if you\nare ready to conclude this business with me, kindly contact me so that\nwe can have a chat over this issue once and for all N/B: I will like\nto inform you again based on the fact that you did not truly execute\nany contract which am the only one privileged to know this i will\ntransfer this fund to fulfill my words,So what you are expected is to\nfollow my directives and instructions.\nFirstly you will assure me of 100% confidentiality, secondly write a\npromissory note that once i make this transfer you will as well return\nmy agreed percentage,Thirdly  you will assist me secure a nice school\nfor my son over there From your email to me, i stand to assure you that\nyou have my word on this. I shall help your family by making sure that\nthis fund is transferred into your account. You know the truth and if\nyou keep dealing with people that are deceiving you, you will only\nhave yourself to blame.I have told you sincerely  that nobody can get\nthis  fund for you because I have block every loopholes that no one\ncan get it for you without my consent, which I refer to the bad\nbehavior from those criminals throughout the time we were processing\nthis payment,I therefore urge you to forget about them and forge ahead\nfor better without remembering the past.\nAnd as you have assured me that you will come out with a sincere mind\nand be plain to me I will help and make this possible in 4 banking\ndays and it will not cost us much but a little because I am in charge.\nAs you  have  promised not to disappoint me, keep it secret, do away\nwith those of your colleagues even though you tell me that you did not\nknow about them, I will assist in every necessary way and transfer\nthis fund to you within four banking days. I am telling you again for\nthe second time you will today apply for legalization of your account\nin the federal court of justice here so as to enable us transfer\nwithout further delay.\nYou are lucky that you came in when we are about finishing the\ncompilation of this payment batch for the second quarter. Now you have\nto agree that you will no longer be registered with the old contract\nnumber but with a fresh  file as a millennium beneficiary to the\nFederal Government of Nigeria of which all the file documents will be\nforwarded to you in agreement while you still keep every thing secret\ntill you get this fund to your account. This is because your original\nfile can not be used in any way for this payment due to the dent and\nirregularities in it, that is a fact and it has to be corrected.\nBest Regard,\nProf. Williams Benald\nCBN Director   "

        "body": "Hello Prof. Williams Benald,\n\nThank you for your detailed message. I must say, it's quite a lot to take in! It seems like there has been a lot of confusion and miscommunication regarding this matter.\n\nI'm sorry to hear about the difficulties you've faced with my supposed Nigerian friends. I can assure you that I have no knowledge of these individuals or any agreement they may have made on my behalf.\n\nYou mentioned something about a contract that was not executed in Nigeria? Could you please clarify what this contract was for? And why is my name associated with it?\n\nAlso, could you explain more about the stamp duty issue? What does it mean and how does it affect the release of funds?\n\nLastly, I would appreciate if you could provide more information about the KTT FUND RELEASE APPROVALS DOCUMENTS. What are these documents and why are they important?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nAmanda"
