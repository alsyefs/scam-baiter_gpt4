        "body": "  Hello ,\nYour Abandoned Package For Delivery\nI am Mr. jeffery Yates, head of luggage/baggage storage facilities\nDuring my recent WITHHELD PACKAGE routine check at the Storage Vault,I\ndiscovered an abandoned shipment from a Diplomat  it revealed an\nundisclosed sum of money in a Metal Trunk Box weighing approximately\n110kg. The consignment was abandoned because the Contents of the\nconsignment was not properly declared by the consignee as \"MONEY\"\nrather it was declared as personal effect to avoid interrogation as\nwell as, the inability of the diplomat to pay for the United States\nNon Inspection Charges which is $3,700USD. The details of the\nconsignment including your email address and the official documents\nfrom the United Nations office in Geneva are tagged on the Trunk box.\nHowever, to enable me confirm if you are the actual recipient of this\nconsignment, I will advise you provide your current Phone Number and\nFull Address, to enable me cross check if it corresponds with the\naddress on the official documents including the name of nearest\nAirport around your city. Please note that this consignment is\nsupposed to have been returned to the United States Treasury\nDepartment as unclaimed delivery due to the delay in concluding the\nclearance processes so as a result of this, I will not be able to\nreceive your details on my official email account. So in order words\nto enable me cross check your details, I will advise you send the\nrequired details to my private email address for quick processing and\nresponse. Once I confirm you as the actual recipient of the trunk\nbox,I can get everything  concluded within 48 hours upon your\nacceptance and proceed to your address for delivery.\nLastly, be informed that the reason I have taken it upon myself to\ncontact you personally about this abandoned consignment because I want\nus to transact this  and share the money 70% for you and 30%for me\nsince the consignment has not yet been returned to the United States\nTreasury Department after being abandoned by the diplomat so\nimmediately the confirmation is made, I will go ahead and pay for the\nUnited States Non Inspection Fee of $3,700 dollars and arrange for the\nbox to be delivered to your doorstep Or I can bring it by myself to\navoid any more trouble but you have to assure me of my\n30% share.\nI wait to hear from you urgently if you are still alive and I will\nappreciate if we can keep this deal confidential. Please get back to\nme via my private Email:yatesjeffery633@gmail.com for further\ndirectives.\nThanks,\njeffery yates   "

It's like something out of a movie!\n\nI'm curious though, how did you manage to find my email address? And why was the package abandoned in the first place? Also, could you tell me more about this United States Non Inspection Fee?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nLeslie"

That's why he has to\r\nabandon the boxes and run away.\r\n\r\nBut in this case,I am not trying to impose charges on your head but I want\r\nto really help you pay the total sum of $3,700 which was the fee that made\r\nthe diplomat abandon the funds.\r\n\r\nBut you will have to assure me that as soon as the delivery gets to you,my\r\n30% will be given to me for the job well done\r\n\r\nMeanwhile,you will be required to get back to me fast with the below\r\ndetails so that once I get the $3,700 Non-Inspection fee paid ,the delivery\r\nwill be made to you without any further delay.\r\n\r\nHome Address............\r\nPhone Number...........\r\nA Copy Of Identification.......\r\n\r\nAs soon as the above details are received,the delivery process will\r\ncommence immediately and I will send to you an official payment receipt\r\nwhich shows that the $3,700 has been paid by me\r\n\r\nI await the confirmation of the above date as soon as possible.\nRegards,\r\n\r\nJeffery Yates"
