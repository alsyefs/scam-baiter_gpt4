I must say, it's quite a lot to take in. \n\nI understand that there have been some issues with corrupt government officials and my name has somehow been involved. It's a bit surprising to hear, but I appreciate your team's efforts in resolving this matter.\n\nYou mentioned that my payment has been moved to the European continent from West Africa. Could you please elaborate on what this payment is for? Also, could you provide more details about these legal papers and genuine documents that I need to obtain?\n\nI'm also curious about the role of my legal lawyer in this process. What exactly will they be required to do?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nP.S: I'm sorry but as per my personal policy, I don't share personal information like date of birth or passport details online.\n\nBest wishes,\nCarlos"
