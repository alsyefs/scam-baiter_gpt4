It's quite intriguing, I must say. However, before we proceed further, could you please provide more information about how this box came into your possession? Also, what exactly does it mean that my \"was tagged family valuables\"? \n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nMarceline"
