        "body": "Dear Sir,\nI am Mr. Edward Kong, the Vice President and Branch Manager of The Bank of\nEast Asia (USA), Flushing Branch Flushing New York, USA. I write to seek\nyour consent to carry out a transaction that would be highly beneficial to\nyou and me. I know you may be wondering why I am contacting you for this\ndespite all the friends and relations that I have but I decided to do this\nwith an unknown person to avoid any form of blackmail in the future.\nMr. Alvin Peter Kappelmann Jr was an account holder with my bank. I have\nbeen his account officer for 11 years before his death. He died during the\nWorld Trade Centre bombing in September 11 2001.\nSince his death, the management of my bank has made series of efforts to\nlocate his family but all efforts were proved abortive. I also carried out\nseries of research to find his family but it was confirmed that the mother\nwho was the only surviving member of the family died at the hearing of the\nfact; no one was able to claim the fund he deposited in my bank legally\nbecause there was no will to it. He had a secret dollar account with my\nbank worth the sum of $58,200,000.00 (Fifty Eight Million, Two Hundred\nThousand United States Dollars) with an interest agreement of 6.7% which\nhave been for the past 9 years.\n  My purpose of contacting you now is this:\nMy bank during the last executive board meeting resolved that if by the\nend of this year and there is no beneficiary to the said account, the\naccount will be confiscated and the fund sent to the bank treasury and\nthis is where I am interested in and wants you to come in:\nI want you to come in as the Next of Kin/Beneficiary to this account. I\nhave all the titled documents to back your claim and as the Vice President\nand Manager of this branch, it is in my power to carry out any form of\nverification on the beneficiary of the said fund and process the fund wire\nwithout any problem. I want you to know that \nthis is legal and 100% risk\nfree as all the titled documents would be changed to your name and the\nfund wired to any bank account you wish to have it wired to.\nPlease note that I am willing to let you have 40% of the total sum while\nyou give me 60% when the fund finally gets to your nominated bank account.\nAlso note that I am willing to go extra mile to make this a success\nbecause \nif anything goes wrong, then I stand the risk of losing my job and\neven go to jail for trying to carry out such transaction\n.  This is why I\nam contacting you so that we can put heads together and take care of this\ntransaction within the next 9 days.\nKindly get back to me immediately so that I advice you on how this would\nbe carried out.Reply all email to; \nInfo.edkong@gmail.com\nSincerely,\nMr. Edward Kong"

        "body": "Hello Mr. Edward Kong,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me with such an intriguing proposition. I must admit, it's not every day that one receives an email of this nature. \n\nI'm sorry to hear about the unfortunate fate of Mr. Alvin Peter Kappelmann Jr and his family. It's truly a tragedy when lives are lost in such horrific events.\n\nYour proposal is quite interesting, but I have a few questions if you don't mind clarifying for me. Firstly, how did you come across my contact information? And why do you believe I would be the right person to act as the Next of Kin?\n\nSecondly, could you please explain more about what this process would entail on my end? What kind of responsibilities would I need to take on?\n\nLastly, could you provide some more details about these titled documents? How can they be legally transferred to my name?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nMarie"

        "body": "My Dear Friend & Confidant,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you so much for your prompt reply to my mail. First let me state once\r\nagain that I have been prompted to trust you and will depend on you to show\r\nme maximum trust, confidentiality and above all follow my instruction\r\nstrictly. As you will understand the transaction is 100% success assured in\r\nas much as you follow my instructions, within a period of 9 banking days we\r\nwill finish all the documentary aspect of this transaction and money\r\ntransferred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI will demand that you give me the privilege to handle the whole issue with\r\nmy professional experience and position. I have to at this point ask for\r\nyour sincere confidentiality, please assure me this and keep to it that the\r\nnext person to you do not know about this transaction as we have to keep it\r\nhighly confidential. You should know that I am working with the bank and a\r\nmanager in that matter hence my position and job will be at risk should any\r\nbody know l am the one given you information's and data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe basic requirement here is that as you will know I do not want to let my\r\nbank know I am behind the transfer so all our communications will be\r\nrestricted to email unless on a very urgent matter then you can reach me on\r\nmy direct telephone number and if it is convenient to discuss with you at\r\nthe particular time, then we will discuss and if it is not safe for us to\r\ndiscuss, then I will call you immediately it is convenient for me to talk\r\nwith you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI want to make something clear to you, the fact that I am the Vice\r\nPresident and the Manager of this branch does not guarantee the security of\r\nthis transaction, whatever we are doing must be done under a very high\r\nlevel of confidentiality. We must pretend we do not know each other, you\r\nmust never mention my name to any staff of my bank during and after this\r\ntransaction. This is for our security and safety of this transaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe issue of documentation is no problem; I will handle that as soon as we\r\ncommence the transfer process. I reside in 3202 Linden Pl,Flushing NY\r\n11354 and would want us to meet but our meeting will be under a very high\r\nsurveillance to avoid being seen together until this is over. My bank has\r\nsome secret security officers that monitor my movement as senior bank\r\nexecutive and I must play safe to avoid being interrogated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI am an Asian by birth but my mother is an American. I am ready for this\r\ndeal to be accomplished and I wish so from you. My bank will have this\r\napproved since everything about this deposit is with me and the fund in my\r\nbranch.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn no account must you discuss this with anyone; whatever you want to ask\r\nme please do that by email and I will answer you immediately. The fund\r\nwould be transferred through a more secured telegraphic wire transfer means\r\nwith evidence proving the genuine source of the fund and you as the\r\nlegitimate beneficiary of the fund and no government agency can stand\r\nagainst it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith my experience in financial matters, I will handle this. Please do not\r\ncall me on my office telephone number because it will be unsecured to\r\ndiscuss this transaction in my office. Calling me on my office telephone\r\nnumber would mean a stop to this transaction.\r\n\r\nYour full name\r\nHouse/ officer address\r\n\r\nTel.\r\nOccupation.\r\nAge.\r\nMarital status.\r\nIdentification  . SCAN COPY OF YOUR D/L OR INTERNATIONAL PASSPORT\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease get back to me today with the above stated information so that I\r\nwill be able to extract the deposit agreement and then make official\r\napplication of the claim in your name and submit it to the board that meets\r\nonce every week. As soon as I receive your assurance along with the\r\ninformation above, I will advice you on what next to do. For any question\r\nyou may want to ask please send it to me by email, I am very ready to\r\nanswer them. I am guaranteed that they will give the approval instantly as\r\nthe money is in my branch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not want to write so much on the procedure so that you will not be\r\nconfused but I inform you that it is simple and fast. I will be waiting to\r\nhear from you today, I have also attached a copy of my passport for your\r\nperusal. As regards the %, it is the same as I said earlier, 50% for you,\r\n50% for me . in the process of carrying out this transaction.Respond to me\r\ntoday if you can so we can proceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTruly yours,\r\n\nEdward Kong"
