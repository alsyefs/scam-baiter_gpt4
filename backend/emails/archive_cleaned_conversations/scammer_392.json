        "body": "  Attention:\nGreetings to you.\nI am Mr. Olukayode Pitan . I have urgent secret information for you,\nwhich will be of vital help to you, I cannot keep it further as my\nconscience reminds of my duties as one who believes in equity and fair\nplay, my boss and some of his colleagues from several other ministries\nwho are assigned with the duty of transferring this funds to you have\nconspired together to divert your fund to another account and the\nstrategy they employed was by demanding several charges from you, all\nthe demands are illegal just to frustrate you to abandon your funds in\norder to perfect his evil activities. He has counterparts in almost\nevery country like United Kingdom, United States, Spain, Holland\nTaiwan, Hong Kong, Indonesia and India etc.\nAs this will then open an avenue for them to tag your payment as\nunclaimed payment and will have it transfer to their own coded account\noverseas. As a matter of fact, the Executive Governor Central Bank of\nNigeria (CBN) and his colleagues instructed me to change your payment\ndetails with the one they have just nominated for immediate payment,\nnote that they will frustrate you for ever if you continue dealing\nwith them because they will never do the right thing since the quest\nfor too much worldly gains has blinded their sense of reasoning, am in\ncharge of crediting comptroller to infuse all those information but i\nam purposely delaying as my mindset does not accept such evil.\nI can release this fund to you if I am sure that I will be protected\nbecause immediately I release it, I will have to leave office, if I do\nnot my life will be in danger. This money will be transferred to their\nprivate account on before 30th of August 2023. If you are willing to\nget your payment direct into your account or through any other means,\ncall or email me and reconfirm your account particulars and other\nrelated information's if you chooses other legitimate ways let me know\nand forward your contact details to me immediately on the receipt of\nthis message.\nPlease Kindly consider this secret information as highly privileged\nand should be kept till the end of time as having it divulged is a\ngreat risk on my side and your prompt response will do you a lot of\ngood by having the right things done in your payment files and\ndocuments which was regularized by unknown crooks. You should have\nasked why after all the series of fees you paid yet the transaction\nwas still not concluded, is a deliberate act to frustrate you out of\nthe business.\nEmail me upon the receipt of this message.\nLooking forward to your immediate response. For further\nclarifications, do not hesitate to contact my office.\nYours faithfully.\nMr. Olukayode Pitan\nAssistant to the Executive Governor (CBN).\nPersonal Email: \nemailolukayodepitan@gmail.com\n "
