Can you please explain how my name ended up on the foreign debts settlement payment file? \n\nAlso, could you provide more details about the different options for receiving the funds? I'm not very familiar with bank wire transfers, online banking or ATM cards. \n\nLastly, I'm a bit confused about the payment method you mentioned - gift card or bitcoin wallet. Could you clarify what this payment is for?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nJudith"
