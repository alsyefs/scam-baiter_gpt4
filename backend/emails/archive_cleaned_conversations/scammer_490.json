So i decided to contact you to hear from you before security company will proceed with him, now that we know that you're not the one that sent him, i will tell the security company to get him arrest, so as its now i urge you to act fast and claim your fund before it will be too late\r\n\r\nI am waiting for your urgent positive response from the receipt of this mail for more details\r\nRegard\nDavid Gate"
