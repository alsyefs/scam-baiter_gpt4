        "body": "Hello Albertia,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I'm sorry to hear about Mrs. Nina Wang's unfortunate passing. It's always sad when someone leaves this world without any heirs.\n\nI'm intrigued by your proposal, but I have a few questions before we proceed further. Could you please explain more about the industry you mentioned? What kind of business are we talking about here?\n\nAlso, could you provide more details on how this process works? How would the funds be transferred and what would my role be in all of this?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nTim"
