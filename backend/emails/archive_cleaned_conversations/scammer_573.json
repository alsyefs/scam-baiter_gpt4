Garki Abuja\nTel: +234-9086108056\nOur Ref: EUB /SBT/STB\nAttn:Beneficiary\nThis is to inform you that in the course of my investigation as\ndirector of payment verification / implementation committee I came\nacross your name as unpaid fund  of $10.5musd as beneficiary in the\nrecord of the central bank of Nigeria and other banks that are suppose\nto get your funds released to you. My committee was set up by the\npayment reconciliation committee to verify and scrutinize all\noutstanding debts owed to our foreign beneficiaries in accordance to\nthe information received from the United States government and other\ncountries over unpaid huge debts owed to Foreigners.\n Having seen your file and my further questioning to the officials\nof the central of Nigeria bank and ministry of finance as to why your\npayment is still pending reveals the rot and corruption in the system.\nThe bank officials told me that the reason why you haven't received\nyour payment is due to your inability to pay for the required charges\nfor transfer of funds to your account. When I asked them why they\ndidn't deduct the said charges from your principal sum, I was given\nthe flimsy excuse that you never authorized them to do so. When I put\nthe question across to them if they ever advised you that such charges\ncould be deducted from your principal fund,the answer I got was no.\nNow, if you do not tell this beneficiary that such charges could be\ndeducted from his or her principal fund, how will he or she know that\nsuch options are available for such beneficiaries.\n From my investigation I discovered that these bank officials\ndeliberately refused to let the charges be deducted from your\nprincipal fund because they want your fund to remain trapped in the\nbank, while they continue to extort money from beneficiaries under\nsome flimsy excuse. You do not need to pay any money to any official,\nall you are required to do is swear to an affidavit at the federal\nhigh court of Nigeria, authorizing the bank to deduct all charges from\nyour principal fund and transfer the balance of funds after deduction\nto your bank account. If you have spent any money in the past in your\nquest for payment, kindly let me know so that I can follow this up.\nYou can reach me on my phone or email for directive on how you can get\nthe deduction done as soon as possible and get your long awaited fund\nrelease to you.\nCall me +234-80351712345 for conclusion and release your long awaited\nfund which i have just discovered on Unpaid File in my office.\n    Yours sincerely,\n    Abubakar Malami\n    NEW ATTORNEY GENERAL FEDERAL\n    REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA.\n    PHONE: +23481076292915   "
