It's quite interesting to hear about this, although I must admit, I'm not entirely sure what it entails. Could you please provide more details? \n\nYou mentioned Chase Bank and Wise's address in New York - how are these related to the lottery? Is there a specific process or steps that need to be followed?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest wishes,\nFrancisco"
