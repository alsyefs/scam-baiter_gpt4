        "body": "Dear William.\r\n\r\nI confirm the receipt of your mail and the content is well understood and\r\nnoted. Be rest assured that this project is 100% risk free. There is no\r\ntrouble because I did my homework very well. Before we proceed let me take\r\na little time to explain the origin of these funds and why I am sending\r\nthem to you.\r\n\r\nDuring our war campaign then in Iraq, my team was responsible for a lot of\r\nraids on Saddam (Iraqi former president) palaces, while on raid, we\r\ndiscovered the sum of $140 Million dollars packed into military trunk boxes\r\nand hidden in Saddam's underground secret chambers.\r\n\r\nHonestly, my first instinct was to report this to the command officer but\r\non second thought, I have sacrificed years to serve and protect my great\r\ncountry, most of us have lost friends and loved ones while on duty. I have\r\nbeen married twice of which none ever lasted for up to 3yrs due to the\r\nnature of my job. The most painful one is My 16yr old son turned into a\r\ndrug addict as he lacked parental guidance and eventually died of an\r\noverdose. I can't begin to mention all my sacrifices and losses.\r\n\r\nThis is a fortune for both of us hence, the funds belonged to an ex-tyrant\r\nwhom we captured and has been executed by the International Court of\r\nJustice. As the leader of my unit I reported the sum of $120 million\r\ndollars out of the funds discovered and I will use my position to move the\r\nremaining (US$20 million dollars) to you for safekeeping until after my\r\nassignment and retirement.\r\n\r\nThe boxes will be sent as Swift Military Consignment/Courier specially with\r\nimmunity to deliver to your physical mailing address. It will be done this\r\nway to ensure maximum security. I must assure you that you will benefit\r\nvery much and you will never regret assisting me, I have already made solid\r\nplans to ensure that this deal is 100% untraceable.\r\n\r\nYour efforts and assistance will be rewarded with 40% of the money if you\r\nare able to handle this deal and keep the boxes safe until I return to the\r\nU.S. and move to your home contact. I will take care of shipping expenses\r\nincluding insurance. However, once I conclude with the delivery company\r\nthat will nominate their agent who will make the delivery to your country,\r\nI will update you of the delivery itinerary.\r\n\r\nHenceforth, further correspondence should strictly be directed to this\r\nemail ID for security reasons. Nevertheless, re-confirm the following to me\r\nas follows before the final departure of trunks as clearly stated above.\r\n\r\n(a) Your full Names:\r\n(b) Your physical mailing address:\r\n(c) Your direct telephone numbers:\r\n(d) Your occupation:\r\n\r\nThanks for your cooperation, God bless you and America!!\nBest Regards,\r\nStaff Sergeant Williams Ronald Lance.\r\nUnited States Soldier Presently in Syria."

I can't even begin to imagine the things you've seen and experienced during your service. \n\nI'm sorry to hear about the losses you've suffered, especially your son. That must have been incredibly hard for you.\n\nRegarding the funds, it's a lot to take in. You mentioned that this project is risk-free, but could you explain a bit more about how this process works? How does the Swift Military Courier system operate? And what kind of security measures are in place?\n\nAlso, I'm curious about why you chose me for this task. We don't know each other personally, so it's a bit surprising that you'd trust me with such an important responsibility.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nWilliam"
