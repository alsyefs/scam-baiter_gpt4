I'm a bit confused though, could you please clarify a few things for me?\n\nFirstly, what is this payment for? I don't recall having any pending payments. Also, could you explain more about the deduction fee? Why do I need to pay it and how does it work?\n\nLastly, who is Eleanya Chijioke Chukwu? Is he also part of Keystone Bank Group?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest regards.\n\nBest wishes,\nJames"
