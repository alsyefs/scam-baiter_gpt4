I must say, it's quite a surprise to hear about such a large sum of money! \n\nI'm curious though, how did Mr. Paul Douglas from the World Bank come across my name? And why was I chosen for this?\n\nAlso, could you please explain more about the online account creation process? How does it work and what kind of security measures are in place to ensure the safety of these funds?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nRandi"
