I am replying to your email with the help of my nurse/caregiver who have been extremely wonderful and kind towards me.  Beloved, I want you to know that my main aim is to do something for the needy before I depart so please note that this is 100% risk free, but since the doctor has said that I have a short time left  I think the best thing is to put smiles on the Motherless children’s faces. Please before we continue I would like you to promise me that you will open an orphanage home in my name  ANNE TAYLOR FOUNDATION\". Upon your response, I will give you the Bank contact details for you to reach them kindly remember me in your prayers and God bless you.Kindly provide me with your full names and direct contact phone numbers for easier communication.upon your response I will send you the full bank information for you to contact the bank.Thanks and God bless as I await your response.\nRegards\r\nMrs. Anne Taylor.\r\n\r\nSent from the all-new AOL app for iOS"
