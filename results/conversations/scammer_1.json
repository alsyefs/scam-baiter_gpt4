I can assure you that I am very much alive and well, and certainly not suffering from throat cancer. \n\nI'm curious about this Mr. Luis Juan from Mexico who claims to be me. Can you tell me more about him? How did he come into possession of my power of attorney?\n\nAlso, could you please provide more details about the fund that is now lying dormant and unclaimed? How did it come to be in my name?\n\nI appreciate your dedication in monitoring all activities regarding the transfer of funds and contract payment.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nAmy"
