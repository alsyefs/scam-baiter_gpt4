        "body": "Good Morning,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. I must say, this is quite a surprising message to receive! I can assure you that I am very much alive and well, and certainly not suffering from throat cancer.\n\nI'm curious about these gentlemen who claim to be representing me. Could you tell me more about how they proved their identities? And how did they come across my information?\n\nAlso, could you please provide more details about this fund that is supposedly in my name? How did it come into existence and why has it been left unclaimed?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nJustin"
