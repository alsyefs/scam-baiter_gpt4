        "body": "Dear Gregory,\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your email, based on its content, kindly note the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. We are ready to consider possible collaboration with projects between\r\nthe limits of US$1M to US$5Billion. We are ready to fund projects within\r\nany sector and geographical area as long as we find the project as\r\npresented viable after our review. Our offer for funding is based on a debt\r\nfinance of 2.5% interest rate annually which is not limited to any sector\r\nor region.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. All projects are considered for funding independently and the specific\r\nterms and conditions for granting funding also differ from one project to\r\nthe other because projects differ in structure and capital requirements for\r\nits actualization. The specific term for granting funding for a specific\r\nproject can only be finalized after our review and consideration based on\r\nthe offering of the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. For the purpose of consideration of projects for funding purposes, we\r\nwill also expect the project presentation, executive summary and\r\ncomprehensive business plan to support the project. If after our initial\r\nreview we accept to fund the project, we will issue the project owner a\r\nformal loan application form which will be filled. All the sections of the\r\napplication form are meant to collect all data and information necessary\r\nfor considering the loan request.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. The 2.5% interest rate on the loan is constant throughout the duration\r\nof the loan. The duration of the loan is only agreed and determined based\r\non the structure of the project and the duration as requested by the\r\nproject owner at the time of making the loan application to ANI.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Currently our offer for funding is only based on loan/debt finance.\r\nHowever, as part of the funding application process, an evaluation is\r\nrendered by an independent financial consultant who makes a recommendation\r\nto the project owner on the funding scheme which is most workable between\r\nthe project owner and ANI. If at this stage the consultant recommends an\r\nequity stake, we will definitely consider the same, but before then our\r\noffer is based on the loan as offered.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. The funding application process takes within 2– 4 weeks to be finalized\r\ndepending on the timely actions and implementations between both parties.\r\nThe summary of the process includes three important steps\r\n\r\n\r\n- Initial review: As soon as we are in receipt of the comprehensive\r\nbusiness plan and project presentation, we will forward the same for an\r\ninitial review. This initial review is executed internally by our team. If\r\nafter this initial review is confirmed that this project will be funded,\r\nthe project owner will be issued with the loan application form. This loan\r\napplication form is only issued to project owners whose project has been\r\nreviewed and confirmed to receive funding from ANI.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Evaluation/Due diligence process: The completely filled loan application\r\nform as received from the project owner is attached to all project details\r\nand data as received which is forwarded to a private financial consultant.\r\nThis consultant acts independently and will render a final evaluation and\r\ndue diligence. This consultant will discuss with the project owner on all\r\nbest funding options for this project and make a final recommendation to\r\nANI. At the completion of the same, the consultant will also issue to the\r\nproject owner a draft copy of the funding contractual agreement which will\r\ndefine all the terms and conditions for granting the funding in\r\nclear/precise terms. If this term as stipulated is acceptable to the\r\nproject owner, ANI will proceed with the finalization and implementation\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n\r\n- The finalization and implementation process involves a face-to-face\r\nmeeting between ANI's facilitators and the representatives of the project\r\nowner to familiarize and discuss the project, terms and the collaboration.\r\nAfter signing all MOU, we will proceed with the actual implementation which\r\ninvolves fund disbursement to the project owner's designated account.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hope this communication clarifies and guides you accordingly. We will\r\nlook forward to further communication from you in moving forward.\r\n\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\n\r\nOmran Abdullah.\r\nDirector of Corporate Communication\r\nAlba Nova Investment Corporation of Abu Dhabi\r\nPO Box 3235, Level 3, Tower C-1, Street 32, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.\nTel: +971 2 444 4012\r\nEmail: info@albanovainvestments.com"
