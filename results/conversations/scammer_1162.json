        "body": "Hello Rev Poole Benjamin,\n\nThank you for reaching out. I'm quite surprised to hear about this situation. I must say, it's news to me that I have a Fund Box worth millions of dollars! And the story about my supposed death and those two men claiming to be my relatives is quite intriguing.\n\nI'm curious, how did you come into possession of this Fund Box? Also, could you tell me more about these two men, William Huges and John Camel? What exactly did they say about their relationship with me?\n\nAs for the information you're asking for, I'm afraid I can't provide it at this time. But let's continue our conversation and see if we can clear up this misunderstanding.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nPaul"
