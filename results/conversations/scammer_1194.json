I appreciate the time and effort you've put into explaining this process to me. \n\nI'm intrigued by the ATM card bank withdrawal instrument you mentioned. Could you please elaborate more on how it works? Also, I'm curious about the daily withdrawal limit of dollars, is there a reason why it's set at that specific amount?\n\nRegarding the processing fee, could you provide more information on what exactly this fee covers? And why is there a need for me to cover part of it?\n\nI look forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nWalter"
