        "body": "Hello Marie\r\n\r\nHow are you and your family?\r\n\r\nThanks for your prompt response. I appreciate the fact that we are\r\nstrangers for now but knowing that all relationship starts from strangers\r\nto friendship and family in a moment of trust and sincerity so please note\r\nthat trust is very essential in all dealings. My name is Sgt  Joyce\r\nScranton, an American soldier serving in the US military in Camp Stanley\r\nDamascus Syria.  Camp Stanley is one of the military bases run by the\r\nUnited States of America in Syria. It is located close to Damascus and is\r\nconsidered to be the largest part of the Red Cloud Garrison. It is located\r\nrelatively close to the DMZ ( Damascus syria Zone) and aims to ensure the\r\npeace in the area. The history of this military base is not very rich,\r\nalthough old enough. I must thank you for your response once again as this\r\nshows your interest and I appreciate that.\r\n\r\nIn the past years there has been severe Wars/rainfall that caused deadly\r\nflooding and damage to syria.. Some wealthy people including politicians\r\nwere killed and their houses and companies were destroyed as a result of\r\nthe severe floods/War. Majority of them lost their entire family as a\r\nresult of this and a great sum of United States currencies were realized by\r\nthe Government in their business structures, that is houses that were\r\ndestroyed but mostly companies.\r\n\r\nDuring a routine patrol by my unit sometime ago, some of us discovered a\r\nhuge safe buried in a destroyed building. Most of the soldiers in my unit\r\nwere not aware of this as we kept it secret till we had time to personally\r\ninspect the safe and found out it contained the sum of  $6 Million. This\r\npoliticians understood the laws against such amount of currency in the\r\ncountry so I believed they buried it and secretly used it for their\r\npolitical mischief. Three of us who found it decided to split it amongst\r\nourselves and at the moment, I have my share of $2 Million privately\r\nsecured and safe in two trunk boxes without the awareness of anyone but I\r\ncannot continue to hold it back here for long because of my active duty.\r\n\r\nI have a very good, trusted and reliable diplomat who can deliver the boxes\r\nto you as he will be leaving syria. very soon and since he has diplomatic\r\nimmunity, the consignment will not be subject to rigorous screening. I will\r\nprovide you with the name of the diplomat in charge of delivery and I will\r\nalso give him your contact information that you will provide me to enable\r\nhim contact you immediately upon his arrival. In order to ship the baggage\r\nwhich contains the money, I can make arrangement in sending it to any\r\naddress of your choice. The baggage will be tagged diplomatic documents and\r\nancient graphic art material so that the diplomat will not know the\r\ncontents of the boxes. I have decided to send it through diplomatic means\r\nas I do not want this going through banks around here since it will not be\r\nsafe for us.\r\n\r\nI am so sorry to encroach into your privacy in this manner but I got your\r\nemail address from an address journal and I found it pleasurable to contact\r\nyou On the Web for help. I am looking for a trust worthy person I can\r\nentrust this funds to until I get back from my station in Damascus syria.\r\n\r\nMy late husband (Jonathan Scranton) would have taken responsibility of this\r\npackage but I lost him to Fort Hood shooting in 2017. I feel so bad when I\r\nremember his death. His painful death made me to join the US Army. It is so\r\npainful to remember that I lost him on that faithful day. Right now I am\r\ndetermined to fight terrorism with all my strenght. I want to have a very\r\npeaceful retirement, maybe get married again.\r\n\r\nI am sure you will know the best way to handle such an amount of money for\r\nus when it gets to you. I only need your trust, I will start making\r\narrangements to ship them at once. If we are lucky and fast enough, we can\r\nconclude this within the next few days.\r\n\r\nI will send the whole amount since I cannot keep any on me but can I trust\r\nyou? As I already informed you that this is of mutual benefit so once it\r\ngets to you, you are to take 30 percent of the total sum for yourself, keep\r\n60 percent  for me and donate the remaining 10 percent to any charity\r\norganization so that our good Lord will assist and bless us in future.  I\r\nbelieve this is fair enough.\r\n\r\nPlease I would like to know a little bit more about you like what you do\r\nfor a living, if you are married and so on because it is important that I\r\nknow in totality the personality upon whom I transact this deal with. You\r\nshould understand my fears here as this involves a large sum of cash.  We\r\nneed to build trust.\r\n\r\nI want you to know that the knowledge of this money leaving the province of\r\nto any safe location is just between the two of us so please endeavor to\r\nkeep it this way. If you are not capable of handling this huge sum then\r\nplease do not allow me ship them to you. I can find other means of dealing\r\nwith it as I have done everything possible to make this a reality from this\r\nend. We must keep a low profile as a result of the amount in question and\r\nplease do not let me down.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind at all time the need for confidentiality and absolute secrecy\r\nuntil we conclude this deal. Phone conversation is not a safe measure in\r\nthis endeavor besides I cannot call you on the phone or receive fax for I\r\nam not always at base as a result of my operational schedule and active\r\nduty. Hope you are okay with this? Everything must be done by email so I\r\nwill like to know if you are still willing to help as I need your urgent\r\nreply to this regard.\r\n\r\nIf you are not interested then please kindly delete this mail and do not\r\nrespond again rather than giving me false hope. Upon receipt of your email.\r\n\r\nI cannot be seen with any sum above 100 USD around here, as it is not\r\nallowed or make transfers on this course (it will be a serious risk on my\r\nside and bring about awareness on our monitoring team). Though shipment of\r\nsuch with diplomatic immunity is very expensive here. I will deduct\r\nwhatever is the shipping cost from the total fund to enable me pay for the\r\ncost of sending it across to you.\r\n\r\nCONFIDENTIALITY\r\n\r\nNote that the diplomat will not be aware of the content of the boxes so\r\nplease do not tell him that they contain money. The boxes are packaged in a\r\nconsignment as art works and artifacts. Just let him know they belongs to a\r\ndead soldier is who is related to you.  I shall send you the pictures of\r\nmyself and the consignments before handling over to the courier.\r\n\r\nCan you handle this? Get back to me ASAP If you're interested in doing this\r\nfor me, so I can let you know how it will work.\r\n\r\nGod bless you and God bless America. Have a wonderful day.\r\n\r\nI await your response ASAP.\nThanks\r\nJoyce Scranton,"
