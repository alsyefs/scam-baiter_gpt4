I therefore\nmade further investigations and discovered that my client did not\ndeclare any next of Kin or relations in the Deposit paperwork with the\nbank.However   no one will  come forward to claim it according to The\nGovernment Law as provided in section 129 sub 63(N), Banking Edit of\n1961 at the expiration of 10 years the money will revert to the\nownership of the Government, if nobody applies to claim the fund. Most\ntimes shared by the senior management of the bank which is a well know\npractice,you can go and verify.\nMy proposition to you is to seek your consent to present you as the\nNext of Kin and beneficiary of my deceased client so that the proceeds\nof this account valued at US$25.5million can be paid to you, so we can\nshare the amount on a mutually agreed percentage of 70% for me 25% for\nyou and 5% for any charity organization in your Country. All legal\ndocuments to back up your claim as the deceased Next of Kin will be\nprovided by me. Your urgent response will be highly appreciated to\navoid making further contacts.\nFor further details call me on my private number +234 9056839447\nKind Regards\nAttorney\nSir,Uche William Esq\nATTORNEYS AT LAW & SOLICITORS"
