Could you please provide more details about this situation? \n\nYou mentioned someone named Mr. Santos William who claims to be my next of kin and has provided account details. I'm not familiar with this person. Can you tell me more about how he is connected to me?\n\nAlso, it's quite alarming to hear that someone reported my death last year! Rest assured, I am very much alive and well.\n\nI appreciate your efforts in trying to remit my fund through Allied Investment Bank. However, before we proceed further, could you please explain the process in detail? What are the steps involved and what kind of compliance do you need from me?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nKevin"
