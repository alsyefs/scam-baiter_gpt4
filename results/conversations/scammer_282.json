        "body": "Hello Dr. David Clark,\n\nWow, this is such exciting news! I can't believe my US million has been wired to my bank account. I'm just a simple person and this kind of money is beyond my wildest dreams.\n\nI'm curious though, how did you get my bank details? And why was the payment delayed? Also, could you please explain what the Financial Services Authority FSA does?\n\nI'm sorry but I don't remember sending any money to Nigeria or London. Could you please clarify that for me?\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nMicheal"
