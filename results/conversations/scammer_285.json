        "body": "Attention,\nI am David Brown, Head Officer-in-Charge, Administrative Service\nInspection Unit United Nations Inspection Agency in Hartsfield-Jackson\nInternational Airport Atlanta, Georgia. During our investigation, I\ndiscovered an abandoned shipment through a Diplomat from the United\nKingdom which was transferred from JF Kennedy Airport to our facility\nin Atlanta, and when scanned it revealed an undisclosed sum of m0ney\nin 2 Metal Trunk Boxes weighing approximately 130kg.\nThe consignment was abandoned because the Content was not properly\ndeclared by the consignee as m0ney rather it was declared as a\npersonal effect/classified document to either av0id diversion by the\nShipping Agent or confiscation by the relevant authorities. The\ndiplomat's inability to pay for Non-Inspection fees among other things\nis the reason why the consignment is delayed and abandoned.\nBy my assessment, each of the boxes contains $ 4M  which is a total of\n$ 8 million USD. They are still left in the airport storage facility\nt0day. The Consignments like I said, are two metal trunk boxes\nweighing about 65kg each (Internal dimension:  W61 x H156 x D73 (cm)\neffective capacity: 680 L) Approximately. The details of the\nconsignment including your n a m e and email on the official document\nfrom the United Nations office in London where the shipment was tagged\nas personal effects/classified document is still available with us. As\nit stands n o w, you have to reconfirm your full n a m e, P H O N E\nNumber, and full address so I  can cross-c h e ck and see if it\ncorresponds with the one on the official documents. It is n o w left\nto you to decide if you still need the consignment or allow us to\nrepatriate it back to the UK (place of origin) as we were\ninstructed.Pls make sure that you Reply to this email:\ndddavidbbbrownnn@gmail.com\nAs I did say again, the shipper abandoned it and ran away most\nimportantly because he gave a false declaration, he could not pay for\nthe yellow tag, he could not secure a valid non-inspection\ndocument(s), etc. I am ready to assist you in any way I can f o r you\nto g e t back these packages provided you will also give me something\nout of it (F I N A N C I A L gratification). You can either come in\nperson or engage the services of a secure shipping/delivery\nCompany/agent that will provide the necessary security that is\nrequired to deliver the package to your doorstep or the destination of\nyour choice. I need the guarantees that I can g e t from you before I\ncan g e t involved in this project.\nBest Regards,\nDavid Brown\nHead Officer-in-Charge\nAdministrative Service Inspection Unit."
