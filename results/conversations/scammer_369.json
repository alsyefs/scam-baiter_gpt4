I must say, it's not every day that one hears about abandoned shipments worth millions!\n\nCould you please provide more details about these boxes? What exactly do they contain? And how did my name end up being associated with them?\n\nAlso, could you clarify what you mean by \"custom clearance charges are perfected\"? How does this process work and what would be required from my end?\n\nLooking forward to your response.\n\nBest wishes,\nLeigh"
