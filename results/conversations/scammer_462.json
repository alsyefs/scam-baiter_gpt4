        "body": "Hello Chief Adebayo Olawale Edun,\n\nThank you for reaching out to me. It's quite an honor to be contacted by the Minister of Finance of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. I must say, this is a surprise!\n\nI'm curious about how my file ended up in your office. Could you please provide more details on that? Also, could you explain what exactly this outstanding foreign debt is about? I don't recall having any debts, let alone foreign ones.\n\nAs for the information you requested, I'm afraid I can't share my banking details over email due to security reasons. However, I'd be happy to discuss further details regarding this matter.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nThomas"
