Due to this fact we have been unable to reach you and other beneficiaries as we have sent you numerous emails so as to carry out our duty in respect to your inheritance in our storage facility.\nTruly we have used quite some other means to contact you but all have not been successful, I strongly believe this time around you will respond back to us and our email will meet you in good health as we have so many individuals whose inheritance are in our storage facilities all around the world.\nFor United States Citizens the Government have subsidised your inheritance and you are to pay ZERO amount of money to receive your inheritance. For inheritance in our storage which belongs to NON-United States Citizens the Government has placed just a little fee of 150$ for its complete processing and delivery of your Inheritance.\nI will want you to know that the inheritance is a cash amount of One Million One Hundred And Fifty Five Thousand Dollars Only ($1,155,000.00)\nAm strongly hoping to get a response from you this time around.\nYou can contact me on :-    \nhumanresources_office@zohomail.com\nYours Sincerely\nHead OF HR   "
