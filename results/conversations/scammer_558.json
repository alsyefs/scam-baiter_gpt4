        "body": "  Hello, \n \nMy sincere apology for this unsolicited letter to you. I am aware that this is certainly not a conventional way of approach to establish a relationship of trust, but you will realize the need for my action. \nI am Mr.Ignacio Dopereiro(Barrister) of Ignacio Romero Dopereiro & Asociados, based in Madrid España. My reason for contacting you is regarding the Estate of a deceased client who died intestate; he was a mining engineer before his death in 2010.\n \nI got your contact details from the Global Journals, while searching for a possible relation to my late client who died as a result of injuries he sustained in an earthquake that occurred in Haiti on the 12th of January 2010 while he was on vacation. \nI first met him in Zimbabwe in 2001 during a conference on mining and environment related issues; we introduced ourselves and later became good friends; we have worked on various projects and then built a strong bond as good friends. During the political crises in Zimbabwe in 2004, I advised him to migrate to Spain and settle here for safety reasons, that’s why he decided to relocate to Spain.  \n \nBefore his death; he deposited the sum of Є15.750.000 (Fifteen Million Seven Hundred and Fifty Thousand Euros) with one of the financial Institutions here in Spain. The funds have remained unclaimed for some years. According to banking laws, once a deceased fund exceeds a specific period of time, it will probably be reverted to the bank’s treasury and subsequently most of it relinquished to the state.  \n \nThe bank, being aware of his death; has appointed me based on local inheritance law to provide any of his distant relatives/family members to make Claims of his funds to avoid it being reverted to the bank’s treasury as unclaimed. However, these laws are unjust and inhumane as it often creates an avenue for some financial institutions/officials to divert such fortunes for their own selfish use. On that ground, I decided to search for any of my late client’s relatives which has proved abortive because he died intestate.  \n \nAgainst this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that; by virtue of my position as his personal Attorney; I would like to present you before the bank as the distant relative of the deceased. I will prepare every relevant document that will assist your claims and facilitate the release of the fund to you. After perfectly taking care of the necessary legal paperwork which the procedure entails; all etiquette shall be done strictly in accordance with subject to the laws of Spain and all internal laws of bequeathment; trust me this will pass very easy because you bear the same family last name with him and also for me being his personal attorney.\n \nI have contacted you in a confidential manner, and would respectfully request you to keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you may come by as a result of this letter. This claim requires a high level of confidentiality.\n \nI understand that this might be a smack of unethical practice; but I want you to understand that it is only an outsider of the legal world that would find this aberrational; this transaction is 100% risk free. I have worked out all modalities to complete the transaction successfully. Once the funds are released to you, we shall share it equally on a 50%/50% ratio. I will beg you not to betray my confidence. If you are interested, please act swiftly and get back to me at: \nignacio_dopereiro@gmx.com\nfor further detail. As soon as I hear from you, I will give you more details and we shall have an in-depth discussion regarding a successful completion of this transaction. \n \nRespectfully,\n \nBARRISTER IGNACIO ROMERO DOPEREIRO.

        "body": "Dear Christopher, \n Thank you for your response response to my Letter. \n \n As I had explained in my previously letter, I got your contact discreetly during my own personal search for a possible relative of my client but to no avail,so I decided to contact you based on the shared surname with Rafael. I also will like to assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free, and it's going to be carried out under a legitimate arrangement that will not breach either the law of your Country or mine. I have worked out all modalities to complete the transaction successfully. Once the funds are released to you, we shall share it equally on 50%/50%. I will beg you not to betray my confidence and also to keep the transaction highly confidential. Having received your response,I hereby bring to your attention the complete details of the transaction, as well as my plan for its smooth conclusion in utmost 14 to 21 days. The money in question was as a result of an abandoned deposit by my late client. \n \n It is absolutely necessary for me to make it take the resemblance of an actual next of kin. As you may know, next of kin is not limited to relations of the deceased, nor is it confided to the circuit of parental relationship, rather it is by choice of the benefactor as regards to whom he wish to be the (Beneficiary) either formally by write up, or informally by secret information disclosure to beneficiary, be him/her business partner, relation, kinsmen, or friends or well wishers. For us to proceed, I will have to write an official application to the bank, presenting you to them as the distance relation to my client and I am sure that the bank will acknowledge the application positively because you both share the same last name, also coupled with the fact that I was his official and personal attorney,which the bank was aware of before his passing. I will officially register these claims at the court and the Notary office here in Spain as soon as the bank has acknowledged it. Therefore, I will request you to send me the below listed information to enable me commence with the official Application to the bank. 1)* Your full names as they appear on your ID. 2)* Confirm your current Residential Address. 3)* Your Government issued ID Number. 4)* Date of birth. As soon as I receive the above information, I will prepare and officially send an application letter to the bank, presenting you to them as the next of kin to my client.After the bank’s Verification, if they are satisfied with the sent application, it will be acknowledged and you will be contacted by them within the maximum period of 24 to 72 hours from the time the application was sent to them, which then determines our way forward in this transaction. We have to follow all the necessary procedures and documentation to enable us to achieve this goal. To achieve success in this endeavor hitch free, here are some important points we must take into consideration and to heart; 1. Mutual confidentiality: As a professional attorney who has put in over two decades of service in the legal field here in Spain; I will want you to maintain sealed lips as far as this project is concerned. You must not disclose any part of the details of this project to a third party without my consent. It will be very disastrous if the true details of this project are brought to the knowledge of unfriendly security agents or third parties. 2. Honesty: We have to be honest to each other as it is when we are honest, that we can do things in unison and achieve our goal. Do not ever plan to jilt me off my share when you finally have the whole money in your possession. Let me trust you, so that we can become achievers together. With these outlined factors if carefully and meticulously adhered to, success will be our own. As soon as the funds are being released and transferred to you, I will apply for the final closing of his account with the bank. I will then make out plans of coming down to your country and invest my own part of the funds. I have plans of investing my own share of the funds in real estate outside Spain. The reason for this is because I have my intentions of going into politics next year, and will not want anything that will jeopardize my political ambition. Thank you for your anticipated support as I wait to receive your response and the above information in a timely manner. Best Regards \nBarrister Ignacio Romero Dopereiro, (Abogados) \n \n \n Sent: Friday, February 02, 2024 at 8:33 PM From: \"Christopher\" <vx86925@***.com> To: ignacio_dopereiro@gmx.com Subject: Re: Hello, \n \nDear Barrister Ignacio Romero Dopereiro, \nI received your letter with great surprise.

        "body": "Dear ,\n\nThank you for your prompt response. I understand your concerns and I assure you that this transaction is completely legitimate.\n\nMy late client, Mr. Rafael, was a successful businessman here in Spain. Unfortunately, he passed away in a car accident along with his immediate family members leaving no heir to his estate. After several unsuccessful attempts to locate any distant relatives, the bank has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or the funds will be confiscated.\n\nGiven that you share the same surname with my late client, I decided to present you as the next of kin so that we can claim these funds rather than letting it go to waste. This is entirely legal as the law here stipulates that in cases where the deceased have no known relatives, an individual who shares the same surname can be presented as the next of kin.\n\nYour role would be simply to stand as the next of kin to my late client. All necessary paperwork will be handled by me and my team. Once we successfully claim these funds, they will be transferred to your account and we will then share it equally between us.\n\nI hope this clarifies things for you. Please do not hesitate to ask if you have any more questions.\n\nBest wishes,\nChristopher"
