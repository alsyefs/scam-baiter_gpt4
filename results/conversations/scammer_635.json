It's comforting to know that there are people like you working hard to protect innocent individuals.\n\nI'm a bit confused about some parts of your message, though. Could you please clarify what exactly the \"business\" is that you mentioned? Also, could you explain more about these funds from the World Bank and United Nations?\n\nAs for the receipts and documents, I'm afraid I don't have any at hand right now. However, I'd be happy to assist in any way possible without those.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon.\n\nBest wishes,\nMary"
