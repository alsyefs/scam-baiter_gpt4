I should let you know that I am willing to hand over everything to you. Since I got your response.\r\nPlease provide the me with the following details so that the Assistant Doctor will send it to the Bank in New York where I deposited the fund to file your name as my next of kin who will inherit my fund once I die anytime from now.\r\n(1.)

Complete Bank Information: \r\nYou must promise me that you will carry out the good work I have slated this fund for even when I am dead.\r\nI want you to help me stand as my next of kin to enable the Bank Transfer this US$5,325,000 to you, so that you will take US$3,325,000 out of this US$5,325,000 and give the remaining US$2,000,000 to any Charity Home here in United States, Europe, Africa, Canada and Asia because that was the vow I made to my God Almighty before I became a Missionary.\r\nI will not be able to write to you myself due to the illness, you must therefore try as much as possible to finalize everything as quickly as possible. I don’t have much time left but I wish to accomplish my last dream before departing this world. It is an Assistant Doctor that is helping me to write this mail. Peace of the lord will continue to follow you as I wait for your prompt response. I would expect your earliest compliance.\r\nYour Sister in the lord,\r\nMissionary Monique Janssens.Saints Peter and Paul Church\r\n\r\nWayne"
