        "body": "Hello Dr Atiku Usman,\n\nI'm so glad to hear from you and that your project has been successful! It's wonderful news that you've managed to secure the funds with a new partner from Japan. I hope your investment project in the United Kingdom is going well.\n\nIt's very generous of you to think of me and offer to send an ATM card. However, I'm a bit confused about how this works. Could you please explain more about this process? How does the ATM card work? Is it like a regular bank card?\n\nLooking forward to hearing more about this exciting opportunity!\n\nBest wishes,\nVelva"
